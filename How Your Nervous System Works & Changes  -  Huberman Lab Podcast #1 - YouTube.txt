- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcastwhere we discuss scienceand science-based tools for everyday life.(upbeat guitar music)I'm Andrew Hubermanand I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmologyat Stanford School of Medicine.For today's podcast
we're going to talk aboutthe parts list of the nervous system.Now that might sound boring,but these are the bits and piecesthat together make up everythingabout your experience of life,
from what you think aboutto what you feel, what you imagine,and what you accomplishfrom the day you're born
until the day you die.That parts list is really incrediblebecause it has a history
associated with itthat really provides a window
into all sorts of thingslike engineering, warfare,
religion, and philosophy.So I'm going to share
with you the parts listthat makes up who you arethrough the lens of some of
those other aspects of lifeand other aspectsof the history of the discovery
of the nervous system.By the end of this podcastI promise you're going
to understand a lot moreabout how you work and how
to apply that knowledge.There's going to be a little bit of story.There's going to be a lot of discussionabout the people who made
these particular discoveries.There'll be a little bit
of technical language.There's no way to avoid that.But at the end you're
going to have in handwhat will be the equivalentof an entire semester of learningabout the nervous system and how you workSo a few important points
before we get started.I am not a medical doctor.That means I don't prescribe anything.I'm a professor, so sometimes
I'll profess things.In fact, I profess a lot of things.We are going to talk about
some basic functioningof the nervous system parts and et cetera,but we're also going to talkabout how to apply that knowledge.That said, your healthcare, your wellbeingis your responsibility.So anytime we talk about toolsplease filter it through
that responsibility.Talk to a healthcare professionalif you're going to explore
any new tools or practicesand be smart in your
pursuit of these new tools.Also wanna emphasize that this podcastand the other things I do on social mediaare my personal goal of bringingzero cost to consumer information
to the general public.It is separate from my role
at Stanford University.In that spirit I really want to thankthe sponsors of today's podcast.The first one is Athletic Greenswhich is an all-in-one drink.It's a greens drinkthat has vitamins, minerals,
probiotics, prebiotics.I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012so I'm really delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.The reason I like it is becauseI like vitamins and minerals,I think they're important to my healthand it can be kind of overwhelming to knowwhat to take in that landscape.So by taking one thingthat also happens to taste really goodI get all the vitamins minerals,
et cetera, that I need.There's also a lot of data there nowabout the importance of the gut microbiomefor immune health and
for the gut brain access,all these things.And the probiotics and prebioticsare important to me for that reason.If you want to try Athletic Greensyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,and put in the code word
Huberman at checkout.If you do thatthey'll send you a year's
supply of vitamin D3 and K2.There's a lot in the news latelyabout the importance of vitamin D3.We can all get vitamin D3 from sunlightbut many of us aren't
getting enough sunlight.Vitamin D3 has been shown to be relevantto the immune system and the
hormone systems, et cetera.So once againthat's athleticgreens.com/huberman,enter Huberman at checkout,and you get the year supply of D3 and K2along with your Athletic Greens.This podcast is also brought
to us by Inside Trackerwhich is a health monitoring company.It uses blood tests and
saliva tests to look at thingslike DNA and metabolic markersand monitors your hormones,a huge number of different
parameters of healththat really can only
be measured accuratelythrough blood and saliva tests.I use Inside Tracker because
I'm a big believer in data.There's a lot of aspects to our biologythat can only be accurately measuredby way of blood tests and saliva tests.The thing that's really
nice about Inside Trackeris that rather than just giving
you a bunch of numbers backof the levels of these
things in your body,it gives you, through a
really simple platform,information about what to dowith all those levels of hormonesand metabolic markers, et cetera.It also has a feature which
is particularly interestingwhich it measures your inner age,which is more a measure
of your biological ageas opposed to your chronological age.And all that information is organizedso that you can make changesin your nutritional regimes
or your exercise regimesand watch how those
markers change over time.So if you want to try Inside Trackeryou can go to insidetracker.com/hubermanand they'll give you 25% off at checkout.So let's talk about the nervous system.The reason I say your nervous
system and not your brainis because your brain is
actually just one pieceof this larger, more
important thing, frankly,that we call the nervous system.The nervous system includes
your brain and your spinal cordbut also all the connections
between your brainand your spinal cord and
the organs of your body.It also includes, very importantly,all the connections between your organsback to your spinal cord and brain.So the way to think about how
you function at every levelfrom the moment you're
born until the day you die,everything you think and
remember and feel and imagineis that your nervous system
is this continuous loopof communication between the
brain, spinal cord, and bodyand body, spinal cord, and brain.In fact, we really can't
even separate them.It's one continuous loop.You may have heard of something
called a Mobius strip.A Mobius strip is almost like one ofthese impossible figures
that no matter which angleyou look at it fromyou can't tell where it
starts and where it ends.And that's really how your
nervous system is built.That's the structure that
allows you to, for instance,deploy immune cells,to release cells that
will go kill infectionwhen you're in the presence of infection.Most people just think about thatas a function of the immune systembut actually it's your nervous systemthat tells organs like your spleento release killer cells
that go and hunt downthose bacterial and viral
invaders and gobble them up.If you have a stomach ache, for instance,sure, you feel that in your stomach,but it's really your nervous systemthat's causing the stomach ache.The ache aspect of it is
a nervous system feature.So when we want to talk about experienceor we want to talk about how
to change the self in any way,we really need to think about
the nervous system first.It is fair to saythat the nervous system governsall other biological systems of the body,and it's also influenced by
those other biological systems.So if we're talking
about the nervous systemwe need to get a little
specific about what we mean.It's not just this big loop of wires.In fact, there's a
interesting story about thatbecause at the turn of the
sort of 1800s to 1900s,it actually was believedthat our nervous system
was just one giant cell.But two guys, that names
aren't super important,but in fairness to their
important discovery,Ramon y Cajal, a Spaniard,
Camillo Golgi, an Italian guy,figured out how to label
or stain the nervous systemin a way that revealed, oh my goodness,we're actually made up of
trillions of these little cells,nerve cells that are called neurons.And that's what a neuron is.It's just a nerve cell.They also sawthat those nerve cells
weren't touching one another.They're actually separated by little gaps.And those little gaps you
may have heard of before,they're called synapses.Those synapses are where the chemicalsfrom one neuron are kind of
spit out or vomited into.And then the next nerve
cell detects those chemicalsand then passes
electricity down its lengthto the next nerve cell and so forth.So really the way to think about
your body and your thoughtsand your mind is that you are
a flow of electricity, right?There's nothing mystical about this.You're a flow of electricitybetween these different nerve cells.And depending on which
nerve cells are activeyou might be lifting your
arm or lowering your arm.You might be seeing something
and perceiving that it's redor you might be seeing somethingand perceiving that it's green,all depending on which nerve
cells are electrically activeat a given moment.The example of perceiving
red or perceiving greenis a particularly good examplebecause so often our
experience of the worldmakes it seem as if these out these thingsthat are happening outside usare actually happening inside us.But the language of the nervous
system is just electricity.It's just like a Morse code of some sortor the syllables and words and consonantsand vowels of language.It just depends on how
they're assembled, what order.And so that brings usto the issue of how the
nervous system works.The way to think about how
the nervous system worksis that our experiences, our memories,everything is sort of
like the keys on a pianobeing played in a particular order, right?If I play the keys on a
piano in a particular orderand with a particular
intensity, that's a given song.We can make that analogous
to a given experience.It's not really that the key, you know,A sharp or E flat is the song.It's just one component of the song.So when you hear that,
you know, for instance,there's a brain area
called the hippocampus,which there is, that's involved in memory.Well, it's involved in memory,but it's not that memories
are stored there as,you know, sentences.They're stored there as patterns
of electricity in neuronsthat when repeated, give you the sensethat you are experiencing the thing again.In fact, deja vu,the sense that what you're
experiencing is so familiarand like something that
you've experienced previouslyis merely that the neuronsthat were active in one circumstanceare now becoming active in
the same circumstance again.And so it's really just
like hearing the same songmaybe not played on a pianobut next time on a classical guitar,there's something similar about that songeven though it's being played
on two different instruments.So I think it's importantthat people understand the
parts of their nervous system,and that it includes so much
more than just the brainand that there are these
things, neurons and synapses.But really that it's
the electrical activityof these neurons that
dictates our experience.So if the early 1900s were whenthese neurons were discovered,certainly a lot has happened since then.And in that time between
the early 1900s and nowthere's some important eventsthat actually happened in historythat gave us insight into
how the nervous system works.One of the more surprising
ones was actually warfare.So as most everybody knows in warfarepeople get shot and people often diebut many people get
shot and they don't die.And in World War One, there
were some changes in artillery,in bullets that made for a situationwhere bullets would
enter the body and brainat very discrete locationsand would go out the other
side of the body or brainand also make a very small
hole at that exit location.And in doing so produced a lotof naturally occurring
lesions of the nervous system.Now you say, okay, well,
how does that relateto neuroscience?Well, unlike previous yearswhere a lot of the artillery
would create these bigsort of holes as the bulletswould blow out of the brain or body,I know this is rather gruesome,when the holes were very discretethey entered at one point
and left at another point,they would take out or destroyvery discrete bits of neural
tissue, of the nervous system.So people were coming back from warwith holes in their brainand in other parts of their nervous systemthat were limited to
very specific locations.In addition to that,
there was some advancementin the cleaning of wounds that happenedso many more people were surviving.What this meant was that neurologistsnow had a collection of patientsthat would come back and they'd have holesin very specific locations of their brain.And they'd say things like,
well, I can recognize facesbut I can't recognize who
those faces belong to.I know it's a face, but I
don't know who it belongs to.And after that person eventually diedthe neurologist would figure out,ah, I've had 10 patients that all told methat they couldn't recognize faces.And they all had these bullet holesthat went through a particular
region of the brain.And that's how we know a lotabout how particular brain regionslike the hippocampus work.In fact, some of the more
amazing examples of this,where people would come
back and they, for instance,would speak in complete gibberishwhereas previously they
could speak normally.And even though they were
speaking in complete gibberishthey could understand language perfectly.That's how we know that
speech and languageare actually controlledby separate portions
of the nervous system.And there are many examples like that.People that couldn't recognize
the faces of famous peopleor, and that actually brings usto an interesting example in modern times.Many, many years later in the early 2000sthere was actually a
paper that was publishedin the journal "Nature",
excellent journal,showing that in a human being,a perfectly healthy human being,there was a neuron that would becomeelectrically active only when the personviewed the picture of
Jennifer Aniston, the actress.So literally a neuron that
represented Jennifer Aniston,so-called Jennifer Aniston cells,neuroscientists know about
the Jennifer Aniston cells.If you can recognize
Jennifer Aniston's faceyou have Jennifer Aniston neurons,and presumably also have neuronsthat can recognize the facesof other famous and non-famous people.So that indicatesthat our brain is really
a map of our experience.We come into the world and
our brain has a kind of biastowards learning
particular kinds of things.It's ready to receive informationand learn that information,but the brain is really
a map of experience.So let's talk about what
experience really is.What does it mean for your brain to work?Well I think it's fair to saythat the nervous system really
does five things, maybe six.The first one is sensation.So this is important to understandfor any and all of youthat want to change your nervous systemor to apply tools to make your
nervous system work better.Sensation is a non-negotiable elementof your nervous system.You have neurons in your eye that perceivecertain colors of light and
certain directions of movement.You have neurons in
your skin that perceiveparticular kinds of touch,
like light touch or firm touchor painful touch.You have neurons in your ears
that perceive certain sounds.Your entire experience of
life is filtered by these,what we call sensory receptorsif you want to know what the name is.So this always raises
an interesting question.People ask, well, is
there much more out there?Is there a lot more happening in the worldthat I'm not experiencingor that humans aren't experiencing?And the answer of course is yes,there are many species on this planetthat are perceiving things
that we will never perceiveunless we apply technology.The best example I could think
of off the top of my headwould be something like infrared vision.There are snakes out there,
pit vipers and so forth,that can sense heat
emissions from other animals.They don't actually see their shape.They sense their heat shape
and their heat emissions.Humans can't do thatunless of course they
put on infrared gogglesor something that would allow themto detect those heat emissions.There are turtles and
certain species of birdsthat migrate long distances
that can detect magnetic fieldsbecause they have neurons,again, it's the nervous system
that allows them to do this.So they have neurons in
their nose and in their headthat allow them to migrate
along magnetic fieldsin order to, as amazing as this sounds,go from one particular
location in the ocean,thousands of miles awayto all aggregate on one particular beachat a particular time of yearso that they can mate, lay eggs,and then wander back
off into the sea to die.And then their young
will eventually hatch,those cute little turtles
will shuffle to the ocean,swim off and go do the exact same thing.They don't migrate that
distance by vision.They don't do it by smell.They do it by sensing magnetic fields.And many other species do
these incredible things.We don't, humans are not
magnetic sensing organisms.We can't do thatbecause we don't have receptors
that sense magnetic fields.There's some data that maybe some humanscan sense magnetic fieldsbut you should be very skeptical of anyonethat's convinced that they can do thatwith any degree of robustness or accuracy,because even the people that can do thisaren't necessarily aware that they can.Maybe a topic for a future podcast.So we have sensation,
then we have perception.Perception is our ability
to take what we're sensingand focus on it and make sense of it,to explore it, to remember it.So really perceptions are
just whichever sensationswe happen to be paying
attention to at any moment.And you can do this right now.You can experience perceptionand the difference between
perception and sensationvery easily.If, for instance, I tell
you to pay attentionto the contact of your feet,
the bottoms of your feet,with whatever surface they
happen to be in contact with,maybe it's shoes, maybe it's the floor,if your feet are up maybe it's air.The moment you place your,what we call the spotlight of attentionor the spotlight of
perception on your feet.You are now perceiving
what was happening there,what was being sensed there.The sensation was happening
all along however.So while sensation is not negotiableyou can't change your receptorsunless you adopt some new technology,perception is under the
control of your attention.And the way to think about attentionis it's like a spotlight,
except it's not one spotlight.You actually have two
attentional spotlights.Anyone that tells you you can't multitask,tell them they're wrong.And if they disagree with
you tell them to contact mebecause in old world
primates of which humans are,we are able to do what's
called covert attention.We can place a spotlight
of attention on something,for instance, something
we're reading or looking ator someone that we're listening to.And we can place a second
spotlight of attentionon something we're
eating and how it tastesor our child running around
in the room or my dog.You can split your
attention into two locationsbut of course you can
also bring your attention,that is, your perception,
to one particular location.You can dilate your attentionkind of like making a
spotlight more diffuseor you can make it more concentrated.This is very important to understandif you're going to think about toolsto improve your nervous system,whether or not that tool is
in the form of a chemicalthat you decide to
take, maybe a supplementto increase some chemical in your brainif that's your choice,or a brain machine deviceor you're going to try
and learn something betterby engaging in some focus
or motivated pursuitfor some period of time each day.Attention is somethingthat is absolutely under your control,in particular when you're rested.And we'll get back to this.But when you are rested, and
we'll define rest very clearly,you are able to direct your attentionin very deliberate ways.And that's because we have
something in our nervous systemwhich is sort of like a two way street.And that two way street is a communicationbetween the aspects of our
nervous system that are reflexiveand the aspects of our nervous
system that are deliberate.So we all know what it's
like to be reflexive.You go through life, you're walking.If you already know how to walkyou don't think about your walking.You just walk.And that's because the nervous
system wants to pass offas much as it can to reflexive action.That's called bottom up processing.It really just means that informationis flowing in through your senses,regardless of what you're perceiving,that information is flowing upand it's directing your activity.But at any moment, for instance,let's say a car screeches in
front of you around the corner,and you suddenly pause.You are now moving into deliberate action.You would start looking around
in a very deliberate way.The nervous system can be
reflexive in its actionor it can be deliberate.If reflexive action tends to
be what we call bottom up,deliberate action and
deliberate perceptionsand deliberate thoughts are top down.They require some effort and some focus.But that's the point,you can decide to focus
your attention and energyon anything you want.You can decide to focus your
behavior in any way you want.But it will always feellike it requires some
effort and some strain.Whereas when you're in reflexive mode,just walking and talking and
eating and doing your thingit's going to feel very easy.And that's because your nervous systembasically wired up to be ableto do most things easily
without much metabolic demand,without consuming much energy.But the moment you try and
do something very specific,you're going to feel a
sort of mental friction.It's going to be challenging.So we've got sensations, perceptions,and then we've got thingsthat we call feelings slash emotions.And these get a little complicated
because almost all of us,I would hope all of us,
are familiar with thingslike happiness and sadness
or boredom or frustration.Scientists argue like crazy,neuroscientists and psychologistsand philosophers for that matter,argue like crazy about what
these are and how they work.Certainly emotions and feelingsare the product of the nervous system.They involve the activity of neurons.But as I mentioned earlier,
neurons are electrically activebut they also release chemicals.And there's a certain
category of chemicalsthat has a very profound influenceon our emotional states.They're called neuromodulators.And those neuromodulators
have names that probablyyou've heard of before.Things like dopamine and serotoninand acetylcholine, epinephrine.Neuromodulators are really interestingbecause they bias which
neurons are likely to be activeand which ones are likely to be inactive.A simple way to think
about neuromodulatorsis they are sort of like playliststhat you would have on any kind of devicewhere you're going to play
particular categories of music.So for instance, dopamine,
which is often discussedas the molecule of reward or
joy, it is involved in reward.And it does tend to create
a sort of upbeat moodwhen released in appropriate
amounts in the brain.But the reason it does
that is because it makescertain neurons and neural
circuits as we call themmore active and others less active.Okay.So serotonin, for instance,is a molecule that when releasedtends to make us feel really
good with what we have,our sort of internal landscapeand the resources that we have,whereas dopamine more than
being a molecule of rewardis really more a molecule of motivationtoward things that are outside usand that we want to pursue.And we can look at healthy conditionsor situations like being
in pursuit of a goalwhere every time we accomplish somethingen route to that goal, a little
bit of dopamine is releasedand we feel more motivation, that happens.We can also look at the extreme exampleof something like mania,where somebody is so
relentlessly in pursuitof external things like
money and relationshipsthat they're sort of in this
delusional state of thinkingthat they have the
resources that they needin order to pursue all these thingswhen in fact they don't.So these neuromodulators can existin normal levels, low levels, high levels.And that actually gives us a windowinto a very important aspect
of neuroscience historythat all of us are impacted by today,which is the discovery of antidepressantsand so-called anti-psychotics.In the 1950s, '60s, and '70s,it was discovered that
there are compounds,chemicals that can increase
or decrease serotonin,that can increase or decrease dopamine.And that led to the developmentof most of what we call antidepressants.Now, the trick here or the problemis that most of these drugs,especially in the 1950s and '60s,they would reduce serotoninbut they would also reduce dopamineor they would increase serotonin,but they would also increasesome other neuromodulator chemical.And that's because all these
chemical systems in the body,but the neuromodulators in particular,have a lot of receptors.Now, these are different
than the receptorswe were talking about earlier.The receptors I'm talking about noware sort of like parking spots
where dopamine is released.And if it attaches to a
receptor, say on the heart,it might make the heart beat fasterbecause there's a certain
kind of receptor on the heart.Whereas if dopamine is releasedand goes and attaches to muscleit might have a completely
different effect on the muscle.And in fact, it does.So different receptors on
different organs of the bodyare the ways that these neuromodulatorscan have all these different effectson different aspects of our biology.This is most salient in the exampleof some of the antidepressants
that have sexual side effectsor that blunt appetite
or that blunt motivation.You know, many of these
which increase serotonincan be very beneficial for people.It can elevate their mood.It can make them feel better.But they also if their,
the doses are too highor if that particular drug
isn't right for somebodythat person experiences
challenges with motivationor appetite or libidobecause serotonin is binding to receptorsin the areas of the brainthat control those other things as well.So we talked about sensation.We talked about perception.When we talk about feelings,we have to consider these neuromodulators.And we have to consider also
that feelings and emotionsare contextual.In some cultures showing a
lot of joy or a lot of sadnessis entirely appropriate,in other cultures it's
considered inappropriate.So I don't think it's fair to saythat there is a sadness
circuit or area of the brainor a happiness circuit
or area of the brain.However, it is fair to
say that certain chemicalsand certain brain
circuits tend to be activewhen we are in motivated states,tend to be active when we are
in non-motivated lazy states,tend to be active when we are focusedand tend to be active
when we are not focused.I want to emphasize alsothat emotions are something
that we generally feelare not under our control.We feel like they kind
of geyser up within usand they just kind of happen to us.And that's because they
are somewhat reflexive.We don't really set outwith a deliberate thought to be happyor a deliberate thought to be sad.We tend to experience themin kind of a passive reflexive way.And that brings us to the next
thing, which are thoughts.Thoughts are really interesting becausein many ways they're like perceptionsexcept that they draw onnot just what's happening in the presentbut also things we remember from the pastand things that we
anticipate about the future.The other thing about thoughts
that's really interestingis that thoughts can be both reflexive,they can just be occurring all the timesort of like pop-up windowson a poorly filtered web browser,
or they can be deliberate.We can decide to have a thought.In fact, right now you could
decide to have a thoughtjust like you would decide
to write something outon a piece of paper.You could decide that you're
listening to a podcast,that you are in a particular location.You're not just paying
attention to what's happening,you're directing your thought process.And a lot of people don't understandor at least appreciate
that the thought patternsand the neural circuits
that underlie thoughtscan actually be controlled
in this deliberate way.And then finally there are actions.Actions or behaviors are perhaps
the most important aspectof our nervous system.Because first of all,our behaviors are actually the only thingthat are going to create any
fossil record of our existence.You know, after we die, the
nervous system deteriorates,our skeleton will remain.But it's, you know, in the momentof experiencing something very joyfulor something very sad, it
can feel so all encompassingthat we actually think
that it has some meaningbeyond that moment.But actually for humans and
I think for all species,the sensations, the
perceptions and the thoughtsand the feelings that
we have in our lifespan,none of that is actually carried forwardexcept the ones that we takeand we convert into
actions such as writing,actions such as words,actions such as engineering new things.And so the fossil record of
our species and each one of usis really through action.And that, in part, is why so
much of our nervous systemis devoted to converting
sensation, perceptions, feelings,and thoughts into actions.In fact, the great neuroscientistor physiologist Sherrington
won a Nobel prizefor his work in mapping
some of the circuitry,the connections between nerve cellsthat give rise to movement.And he said, "Movement is
the final common pathway".The other way to think about it is thatone of the reasons that
our central nervous system,our brain and spinal cord
include this stuff in our skullbut also connects so heavily to the bodyis because most everything
that we experience,including our thoughts and feelings,was really designed to either
impact our behavior or not.And the fact that
thoughts allow us to reachinto the past and anticipate the futureand not just experience
what's happening in the momentgave rise to an incredible capacityfor us to engage in behaviorsthat are not just for the moment,they're based on things
that we know from the pastand that we would like
to see in the future.And this aspect of our nervous
system, of creating movement,occurs through some very simple pathways.The reflexive pathway basicallyincludes areas of the brain stemwe call central pattern generators.When you walk, provided you
already know how to walk,you are basically walkingbecause you have these
central pattern generators,groups of neurons that generateright foot, left foot,
right foot, left footkind of movement.However, when you decide to movein a particular deliberate waythat requires a little more attentionyou start to engage areas of your brainfor top-down processingwhere your forebrain
works from the top downto control those central
pattern generatorsso that maybe it's right foot, right foot,left foot, right foot,
right foot, left footif maybe you're hiking along
some rocks or something.And you have to engage
in that kind of movement.So movement, just like thoughts,can be either reflexive or deliberate.And when we talk about deliberateI want to be very specific
about how your brain worksin a deliberate waybecause it gives rise to
a very important featureof the nervous system that
we're going to talk about next,which is your ability to
change your nervous system.And what I'd like to
center on for a secondis this notion of what does it meanfor the nervous system to
do something deliberately?Well, when you do something deliberately,you pay attention, you are
bringing your perceptionto an analysis of three things,duration, how long something
is is going to takeor should be done,path, what you should be doing,and outcome, if you do somethingfor a given length of time,
what's going to happen.Now when you're walking down
the street or you're eatingor you're just talking
reflexively, you're not doing thiswhat I call DPO, duration, path, outcome,type of deliberate functionin your brain and nervous system.But the moment you
decide to learn somethingor to resist speakingor to speak up when you
would rather be quiet,anytime you're deliberatelykind of forcing yourself over a threshold,you're engaging these brain circuitsand these nervous system circuitsthat suddenly make it feel as
if something is challenging.Something has changed.Well, what's changed?What's changed is that when you engagein this duration, path, and outcometype of thinking or
behavior or way of beingyou start to recruit these neuromodulatorsthat are released from
particular areas of your brain,and also it turns out from your body.and they start cuing
to your nervous system.Something's different.Something's different
now about what I'm doing.Something's different
about what I'm feeling.Let's give an example where perhapssomebody says something
that's triggering to you.You don't like it.And you know you shouldn't respond.You feel like, oh, I shouldn't respond,I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond.You're actively suppressing your behaviorthrough top down processing.Your forebrain is actually preventing youfrom saying the thing that
you know you shouldn't sayor that maybe you should wait to sayor say in a different form.This feels like agitation and stressbecause you're actually
suppressing a circuit.We actually can see examplesof what happens when
you're not doing this well.Some of the examples come from children.If you look at young childrenthey don't have the forebrain circuitryto engage in this top down processinguntil they reach age 22, even 25.But in young children, you see
this in a really robust way.You'll see they'll be
rocking back and forth.It's hard for them to sit stillbecause those central pattern generatorsare constantly going in the background.Whereas adults can sit still.A kid sees a piece of candy that it wantsand will just reach out and grab it.Whereas an adult probably would askif they could have a pieceor wait until they were
offered a piece in most cases.People that have damage
to the certain areasof the frontal lobes don't
have this kind of restriction.They'll just blurt things out.They'll just say things.We all know people like this.Impulsivity is a lack of top down control,a lack of top-down processing.The other thing that will
turn off the forebrainand make it harder to top-down processingis a couple of drinks containing alcohol.The removal of inhibition is actuallyremoval of neural inhibition,of nerve cells suppressing the activityof other nerve cells.And so when you look at peoplethat have damage to their frontal lobesor you look at puppies or
you look at young children,everything's a stimulus.Everything is a potential
interaction for them.And they have a very hard timerestricting their
behavior and their speech.So a lot of the motor system
is designed to just workin a reflexive way.And then when we decide
we want to learn somethingor do something or not do something,we have to engage in this
top-down restriction.And it feels like agitation
because it's accompaniedby the release of a neuromodulator
called norepinephrine,which in the body we call adrenaline.And it actually makes us feel agitated.So for those of you that are
trying to learn something newor to learn to suppress your responsesor be more deliberate and
careful in your responses,that is going to feel challenging
for a particular reason.It's going to feel challengingbecause the chemicals in
your body that are releasedin association with that effortare designed to make you
feel kind of agitated.That low-level tremor
that sometimes people feelwhen they're really, really angryis actually a chemically
induced low-level tremor.And it's the, what I call limbic friction.There's an area of your brainthat's involved in our more
primitive reflexive responsescalled the limbic system.And the frontal cortex is in a friction,it's in a tug of war with
that system all the time.Unless of course you have
damage to the frontal lobeor you've had too much
to drink or something.In which case you tend to
just say and do whatever.And so this is really
important to understandbecause if you want to
understand neuroplasticity,you want to understand how
to shape your behavior,how to shape your thinking,how to change how you're able
to perform in any context,the most important thing to understandis that it requires top-down processing.It requires this feeling of agitation.In fact, I would say
the agitation and strainis the entry point to neuroplasticity.So let's take a look at
what neuroplasticity is.Let's explore it, not as the
way it's normally talked aboutin modern culture,neuroplasticity, plasticity is great.Well, what exactly do people mean?Plasticity itself is just a processby which neurons can
change their connectionsand the way they workso that you can go from thingsbeing very challenging and deliberate,requiring a lot of effort and strain,to them being reflexive.And typically when we
hear about plasticity,we're thinking about positiveor what I call adaptive plasticity.A lot of plasticity can be induced,for instance by brain damage,but that's generally notthe kind of plasticity that we want.So when I say plasticity,
unless I say otherwiseI mean adaptive plasticity.And in particularmost of the neuroplasticity
that people wantis self-directed plasticity.Because if there's one
truism to neuroplasticity,it's that from birth until about age 25the brain is incredibly plastic.Kids are learning all sorts of thingsbut they can learn it passively.They don't have to work
too hard or focus too hard,although focus helps, to learn new things,acquire new languages, acquire new skills.But if you're an adultand you want to change your
neural circuitry at the levelof emotions or behavior or
thoughts or anything really,you absolutely need to ask
two important questions.One, what particular aspectof my nervous system
am I trying to change?Meaning, am I trying to change my emotionsor my perceptions, my sensations?And which ones are
available for me to change?And then the second question ishow are you going to go about that?What is the structureof a regimen to engage neuroplasticity?And it turns out that the
answer to that second questionis governed by how awake
or how sleepy we are.So let's talk about that next.Neuroplasticity is the abilityfor these connections
in the brain and bodyto change in response to experience.And what's so incredibleabout the human nervous
system in particularis that we can direct
our own neural changes.We can decide that we
want to change our brain.In other words, our
brain can change itselfand our nervous system can change itself.And the same can't be said
for other organs of the body.Even though our other organs of the bodyhave some ability to change,
they can't direct it.They can't think and decide,you know your gut doesn't say,oh, you know, I want to be ableto digest spicy foods betterso I'm going to rearrange the connectionsto be able to do that.Whereas your brain can decidethat you want to learn a languageor you want to be less
emotionally reactiveor more emotionally engaged,and you can undergo a series of stepsthat will allow your brain
to make those changesso that eventually it becomes
reflexive for you to do that,which is absolutely incredible.For a long time it was
thought that neuroplasticitywas the unique gift of
young animals and humans,that it could only occur when we're young.And in fact, a young brain
is incredibly plastic.Children can learn three languageswithout an accent reflexively,whereas adults, it's very challenging.It takes a lot more effort and strain,a lot more of that duration,
path, outcome kind of thinkingin order to achieve those plastic changes.We now know, however, that
the adult brain can changein response to experience.Nobel prizes were givenfor the understanding that the young braincan change very dramatically.I think one of the most
extreme examples would befor people that are born blind from birththey use the area of their brainthat normally would be usedfor visualizing objects and colorsand things outside of
them for braille reading.In brain imaging studies it's
been shown that, you know,people who are blind from
birth, when they braille read,the area of the brainthat would normally light
up, if you will, for visionlights up for braille reading.So that real estate is reallocatedfor an entirely different function.If someone is made blind in adulthood,it's unlikely that their
entire visual brainwill be taken overby the areas of the brain that
are responsible for touch.However, there's some evidence
that areas of the brainthat are involved in hearing and touchcan kind of migrate into that area.And there's a lot of interest
now in trying to figure outhow more plasticity can
be induced in adulthood,more positive plasticity.And in order to understand that processwe really have to understand somethingthat might at firstseem totally divorced
from neuroplasticity,but actually lies at the
center of neuroplasticity.And for any of you that are interestedin changing your nervous systemso that something that you want can gofrom being very hard or
seem almost impossibleand out of reach to being very reflexive,this is especially important
to pay attention to.Plasticity in the adult human
nervous system is gated,meaning it is controlled
by neuromodulators.These things that we talked about earlier,dopamine, serotonin,and one in particular
called acetylcholine,are what open up plasticity.They literally unveil plasticityand allow brief periods of timein which whatever information,whatever thing we're sensing
or perceiving or thinking,whatever emotions we feelcan literally be mapped in the brainsuch that later it will become much easierfor us to experience and feel that thing.Now, this has a dark
side and a positive side.The dark side is it's actually very easyto get neuroplasticity as an adultthrough traumatic or terrible
or challenging experiences.But the important question
is to say, why is that?And the reason that's the case is becausewhen something very bad
happens, there's the releaseof two sets of
neuromodulators in the brain,epinephrine which tends to make
us feel alert and agitated,which is associated with
most bad circumstances.And acetylcholine, which tends to createa even more intense and
focused perceptual spotlight.Remember earlier we were
talking about perceptionand how it's kind of like a spotlight.Acetylcholine makes that
light particularly brightand particularly restricted to
one region of our experience.And it does that by making certain neuronsin our brain and bodyactive much more than all the rest.So acetylcholine is sorta
like a highlighter markerupon which neuroplasticity
then comes in later and says,wait, which neurons were activein this particularly alerting
phase of whatever, you know,day or night, whenever
this thing happened.So the way it works is this,
you can think of epinephrineas creating this alertnessand this kind of unbelievable
level of increased attentioncompared to what you
were experiencing before.And you can think of acetylcholineas being the molecule that
highlights whatever happensduring that period of
heightened alertness.So just to be clear,it's epinephrine creates the alertness,that's coming from a subset
of neurons in the brain stemif you're interested,and acetylcholine coming
from an area of the forebrainis tagging or marking the neuronsthat are particularly activeduring this heightened level of alertness.Now that marks the cells,
the neurons and the synapsesfor strengthening,for becoming more likely
to be active in the futureeven without us thinking about it.Okay?So in bad circumstancesthis all happens without
us having to do much.When we want something to happen, however,we want to learn a language,
we want to learn a new skill,we want to become more motivated,what do we know for certain?We know that that process
of getting neuroplasticityso that we have more
focus, more motivation,absolutely requires the
release of epinephrine.We have to have alertness
in order to have focusand we have to have focusin order to direct those plastic changesto particular parts of our nervous system.Now, this has immense implicationsin thinking about the various tools,whether or not those are
chemical tools or machine toolsor just self-induced regimensof how long or how intensely
you're going to focusin order to get neuroplasticity.But there's another side to it.The dirty secret of neuroplasticityis that no neuroplasticity occursduring the thing you're trying to learn,during the terrible event,
during the great event.During the thingthat you're really trying
to shape and learn,nothing is actually
changing between the neuronsthat is going to last.All the neuroplasticity, the
strengthening of the synapses,the addition, in some
cases, of new nerve cellsor at least connections
between nerve cells,all of that occurs at a
very different phase of lifewhich is when we are in sleep
and non-sleep deep rest.And so neuroplasticity,which is the kind of Holy
Grail of human experience of,you know, this is the New Yearand everyone's thinking
New Year's resolutions.And right now, perhaps
everything's organizedand people are highly motivatedbut what happens in March or April or May?Well, that all depends
on how much attentionand focus one can continually bringto whatever it is they're trying to learn,so much so that agitation
and a feeling of strainare actually requiredfor this process of
neuro-plasticity to get triggered.But the actual rewiring occursduring periods of sleep
and non-sleep deep rest.There's a study published last yearthat's particularly relevant
here that I want to share,it was not done by my laboratory,that showed that 20 minutes of deep rest,this is not deep sleep,but essentially doing something
very hard and very intenseand then taking 20 minutes
immediately afterwardsto deliberately turn offthe deliberate focused
thinking and engagementactually accelerated neuroplasticity.There's another study
that's just incredible.And we're going to go into thisin a future episode of the
podcast not too long from now,that showed that if people are
learning a particular skill,it could be a language
skill or a motor skill,and they hear a tone just
playing in the background,and the tone is playing
periodically in the background,like just a bell.In deep sleep, if that bell is playedlearning is much faster for the thingthat they were learning
while they were awake.It somehow cues the
nervous system in sleep,doesn't even have to be in dreaming,that something that
happened in the waking phasewas especially important.So much so that that bell
is sort of a Pavlovian cue,it's sort of a reminder
to the sleeping brain,oh, you need to remember what it isthat you were learning at
that particular time of day.And the learning rates and
the rates of retention,meaning how much people can rememberfrom the thing they learned,are significantly higher
under those conditions.So I'm going to talk about how
to apply all this knowledgea little bit more in this podcast episodebut also in future episodes.But it really speaks to
the really key importanceof sleep and focus,these two opposite ends
of our attentional state.When we're in sleep these DPOs,duration, path, and outcome
analysis are impossible.We just can't do that.We are only in relation to
what's happening inside of us.So sleep is key.Also key are periods
of non-sleep deep restwhere we're turning off our analysisof duration, path, and outcome,in particular for the thingthat we were just trying to learn.And we're in this kind of liminal statewhere our attention is
kind of drifting all over.It turns out that's very importantfor the consolidation, for the changesbetween the nerve cells that will allowwhat we were trying to learn to gofrom being deliberate and hard
and stressful and a strainto easy and reflexive.This also points to how different people,including many modern clinicians,are thinking about how to preventbad circumstances, traumas,from routing their way into
our nervous system permanently.It says that you might want to interferewith certain aspects of brain statesthat are away from the
bad thing that happened,the brain states that
happened the next dayor the next month or the next year.And also, I want to make surethat I pay attention to the
fact that for many of youyou're thinking about neuro-plasticitynot just in changing your nervous systemto add something newbut to also get rid of things
that you don't like, right?That you want to forget bad experiencesor at least remove the
emotional contingencyof a bad relationshipor a bad relationship to some thingor some person or some event.Learning to fear certain things,
less to eliminate a phobia,to erase a trauma.The memories themselves don't get erased.I'm sorry to saythat the memories don't
themselves get erased,but the emotional load of
memories can be reduced.And there are a number of different waysthat that can happenbut they all require this thingthat we're calling neuroplasticity.We're going to have a
large number of discussionsabout neuroplasticity in depth,but the most important thing to understandis that it is indeed a two phase process.What governs the transition
between alert and focusedand these deep rest and deep sleep statesis a system in our brain and body,a certain aspect of the nervous systemcalled the autonomic nervous system.And it is immensely
important to understandhow this autonomic nervous system works.It has names like the
sympathetic nervous systemand parasympathetic nervous systemwhich frankly are complicated namesbecause they're a little bit misleading.Sympathetic is the one that's associatedwith more alertness.Parasympathetic is the
one that's associatedwith more calmness.And it gets really misleadingbecause the sympathetic nervous
system sounds like sympathy.And then people think
it's related to calm.I'm going to call it the alertness systemand the calmness system,because even though
sympathetic and parasympatheticare sometimes used, people
really get confused.So the way to think about
the autonomic nervous systemand the reason it's important
for every aspect of your life,but in particular for neuroplasticityand engaging in these focus statesand in these de-focused statesis that it works sort of like a seesaw.Every 24 hours, we're all
familiar with the factthat when we wake up in the morningwe might be a little bit groggybut then generally we're more alert.And then as evening comes aroundwe tend to become a little
more relaxed and sleepy.Eventually at some point
at night, we go to sleep.So we go from alert to deeply calm.And as we do that, we go
from an ability to engagein these very focused
duration, path, outcometypes of analysesto states in sleep that
are completely divorcedfrom duration, path, and outcomein which everything is
completely random and untetheredin terms of our sensations,
perceptions and feelingsand so forth.So every 24 hours, we
have a phase of our daythat is optimal for thinking
and focusing and learningand neuroplasticity and
doing all sorts of things.We have energy as well.And at another phase of our daywe're tired and we have
no ability to focus.We have no abilityto engage in duration, path,
outcome types of analyses.And it's interesting that
both phases are importantfor shaping our nervous system
in the ways that we want.So if we want to engage neuroplasticityand we want to get the most
out of our nervous systemwe each have to masterboth the transition between
wakefulness and sleepand the transition between
sleep and wakefulness.Now so much has been made
of the importance of sleep.And it is critically importantfor wound healing, for
learning as I just mentioned,for consolidating learning,for all aspects of our immune system.It is the one period of timein which we're not doingthese duration, path, and
outcome types of analyses.And it is critically importantto all aspects of our health,
including our longevity.Much less has been made, however,of how to get better at sleeping,how to get better at the processthat involves falling
asleep, staying asleep,and accessing the states of mind and bodythat involve total paralysis.Most people don't know thisbut you're actually paralyzed
during much of your sleepso that you can't act out
your dreams, presumably.But also where your brain
is in a total idle statewhere it's not controlling anything,it's just left to kind of free run.And there are certain
things that we can all doin order to master that transition,in order to get better at sleeping.And it involves much more
than just how much we sleep.We're all being told, of course,
that we need to sleep morebut there's also the
issue of sleep quality,accessing those deep
States of non DPO thinking.Accessing the right timing of sleep,not a lot has been discussed
publicly, as far as I'm aware,of when to time your sleep.I think we all can appreciatethat sleeping for half an
hour throughout the dayso that you get a total
of eight hours of sleepevery 24 hour cycleis probably very different and not optimalcompared to a solid block
of eight hours of sleep.Although there are people
that have tried this,I think it's been written
about in various books.Not many people can
stick to that schedule.Incidentally, I think it's
called the Uberman schedule,not to be confused with
the Huberman schedulebecause first of allmy schedule doesn't
look anything like that.And second of allI would never attempt
such a sleeping regime.The other thing that is
really important to understandis that we have not
explored, as a culture,the rhythms that occur
in our waking states.So much has been focused
on the value of sleepand the importance of
sleep, which is great.But I don't think that most
people are paying attentionto what's happening in their waking statesand when their brain
is optimized for focus,when their brain is optimizedfor these DPOs, these
duration, path, outcometypes of engagements for
learning and for changingand when are their brain
is probably better suitedfor more reflexive thinking and behaviors.And it turns outthat there's a vast
amount of scientific datawhich points to the existenceof what are called ultradian rhythms.You may have heard of circadian rhythms.Circadian means, circa, about a day.So it's 24 hour rhythmsbecause the earth spins
once every 24 hours.Ultradian rhythms occur throughout the dayand they require less
time, they're shorter.The most important ultradian rhythmfor sake of this discussionis the 90 minute rhythm
that we're going throughall the time in our ability
to attend and focus.And in sleep, we are,
our sleep is broken upinto 90 minute segments.Early in the nightwe have more phase one and
phase two lighter sleep.And then we go intoour deeper phase three
and phase four sleep.And then we return to phase
one, two, three, four.So all night, you're goingthrough these ultradian rhythmsof stage one, two, three, four,one, two, three, four, it's repeating.Most people perhaps know that.Maybe they don't.But you wake up in the morning,these ultradian rhythms continue.And it turns out that we are optimizedfor focus and attention
within these 90 minute cyclesso that at the beginning of
one of these 90 minute cyclesmaybe you sit down to learn something newor to engage in some new
challenging behavior,for the first five or 10
minutes of one of those cyclesit's well-known that the
brain and the neural circuitsand the neuromodulators are
not going to be optimally tunedto whatever it is you're trying to do.But as you drop deeper
into that 90 minute cycleyour ability to focus and to
engage in this DPO processand to direct neuroplasticity and to learnis actually much greater.And then you eventually pop out of thatat the end of the 90 minute cycle.So these cycles are occurring in sleepand these cycles are
occurring in wakefulness.And all of those are governedby this seesaw of alertness to calmnessthat we call the autonomic nervous system.So if you want to master and
control your nervous system,regardless of what tool you reach to,whether or not it's a pharmacologic toolor whether or not it's a behavioral toolor whether or not it's a
brain machine interface tool,it's vitally important to understandthat your entire existence is occurringin these 90 minute cycles,whether or not you're asleep or awake.And so you really need to
learn how to wedge intothose 90 minute cycles.And for instance, it
would be completely crazyand counterproductiveto try and just learn
information while in deep sleepby listening to that informationbecause you're not able to access it.It would be perfectly good,however, to engage in a focused
bout of learning each day.And now we know how longthat focused bout of learning should be,it should be at least one 90 minute cycle.And the expectation should
be that the early phaseof that cycle is going to be challenging.It's going to hurt.It's not going to feel natural.It's not going to feel like flow.But that you can learnand the circuits of your
brain that are involvedin focus and motivationcan learn to drop into
a mode of more focus,get more neuroplasticity in other words,by engaging these ultradian cyclesat the appropriate times of day.For instance, some people
are very good learnersearly in the day and not
so good in the afternoon.So you can start to explore this processeven without any informationabout the underlying neurochemicalsby simply paying attention,not just to when you go to sleepand when you wake up each morning,how deep or how shallow your
sleep felt to you subjectively.But also, throughout the day,when your brain tends to be most anxious.Because it turns out that has a correlaterelated to perception
that we will talk about.You can ask yourselfwhen are you most focused?When are you least anxious?When do you feel most motivated?When do you feel least motivated?By understanding how the different aspectsof your perception, sensation, feeling,thought, and actions,tend to want to be engaged
or not want to be engaged.You develop a very good windowinto what's going to be requiredto shift your ability to focusor shift your ability to engage
in creative type thinkingat different times of
day, should you choose.And so that's where we're
heading, going forward.It all starts with mastering this seesawthat is the autonomic nervous system,that at a course level is a transitionbetween wakefulness and
sleep, but at a finer level,and just as important,are the various cycles, these
ultradian 90 minute cyclesthat govern our life all the time,24 hours a day every day of our life.And so we're going to talk
about how you can take controlof the autonomic nervous systemso that you can better
access neuroplasticity,better access sleep,even take advantage of the phasethat is the transition
between sleep and wakingto access things like
creativity and so forth.All based on studies
that have been publishedover the last 100 years,
mainly within the last 10 yearsand some that are very, very new.And that point to the useof specific tools that will allow youto get the most out of
your nervous system.So today we covered a lot of information.It was sort of a whirlwind tourof everything from neurons and synapsesto neuroplasticity and the
autonomic nervous system.We will revisit a lot of
these themes going forward.So if all of that didn't
sink in in one pass,please don't worry.We will come back to these
themes over and over again.I wanted to equip you with a languageso that we're all developinga kind of common base set of
information going forward.And I hope the information
is valuable to youin your thinking about what
is working well for youand what's working less welland what's been exceedingly challenging,what's been easy for youin terms of your pursuit
of particular behaviorsor emotional states where your challengesor the challenges of people
that you know might reside.As promised in our welcome video,the format of the "Huberman Lab" podcastis to dive deep into individual topicsfor an entire month at a time.So for the entire month of Januarywe're going to explore this
incredible state that is sleepand a related state, which
is non-sleep deep restand what they dofor things like learning,
resetting our emotional capacity.Everyone's probably familiar with the factthat when we're sleep deprivedwe're so much less good at
dealing with life circumstances.We're more emotionally labile.Why is that?How is that?But most importantly,
we're going to talk abouthow to get better at sleepingand how to access better sleepeven when your sleep timing
or duration is compromised.We're also going to talk
about the data that supportthis very interesting state
called non-sleep deep restwhere one is neither asleep nor awake,but it turns out one can recoversome of the neuromodulatorsand more importantly the processesinvolved in sensation, perception,feeling, thought, and action.It's sure to be a very rich
discussion back and forthwhere I'm answering your
questions and providing tools.And I'm certain you're also going to learna lot of information about neuroscienceand what makes up this
incredible phase of your lifewhere you think you're not conscious,but you're actually resetting
and renewing yourselfin order to perform better,
feel better, et cetera,in the waking state.If you want to support the podcast,please click the like button
