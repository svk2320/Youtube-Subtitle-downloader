Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,where we discuss science and science-based toolsfor everyday life.[upbeat music]I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiologyand Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.Today, we're going to talk all about how to optimizeyour workspace for maximum productivity.Indeed, that means to heighten levels of focus,to increase levels of creativity,to improve your ability to task switch.And this could be for sake of school or for work,creative endeavors, personal endeavors,this really extends to everybody.Most often when we hear about how to focusor how to get the most out of our work sessions,we hear about the biology and the psychology of that.We hear about dopamine and we hear about serotoninand we hear about caffeine.And indeed, those are topics that I've covered a loton The Huberman Lab Podcast.Today, we will touch on each of those,but we are mainly going to focus on how we arrangeour physical environment and indeed how we arrange ourselvesin that physical environment,in order to bring out the best in our neurobiology.That is how to put ourselvesinto a heightened state of focus by virtue of things,as simple as where we place our screen, relative to our eyesat a given time of day.Believe it or not, there's excellent research on this,and there's excellent research for instance,on whether or not you should or should not listen to music,whether or not you should use things like binaural beats,and if so, what frequency of binaural beats.We are going to cover all of that, and by the end,you'll have a checklist of things that you can doto optimize your workspace on any budget.I will mention various products and appsthat some of you might find usefulfor optimizing your workspace.But I want to emphasize at the outset that none of thosethat I mentioned are any products or appsthat we have a financial relationship to.And more importantly, you don't need them.I'm going to explain how for zero cost,you can arrange your workspace in waysthat makes you maximally productive, maximally focusand allows you to adapt your workspaceto different environments, whether or not you're traveling,working with others, working alone, et cetera.Just to give you a little hint of where we are going,I will mention a zero cost app that will deliverbinaural beats at a particular frequencythat peer-reviewed research has shown can enhancecertain types of learning and memory.However, peer-reviewed research also showsthat it can diminish performance in other types of tasks.So stay tuned, we'll go into all the detailsso that you can optimize your workspace for zero costand get the most out of your efforts and endeavors.Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcastis separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.It is however, part of my desire and effortto bring zero cost to consumer information about scienceand science related tools to the general public.In keeping with that theme,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.Our first sponsor is LMNT.LMNT is an electrolyte drinkthat has everything you needand none of the things you don't.And when we say everything you need, the main one is salt.Now, salt, aka sodium has kind of a bad rap.We've all heard that too much salt is bad for us.However, if you look into the research on salt,and in fact, if you go to one of the highest level,peer-reviewed scientific publications, Science Magazine,you can find a review article in science some years agothat shows that most of what we think and understandabout the science of salt is completely wrong.And in fact, salt does a number of thingsthat's extremely important.For instance, our neurons, which signal to one anotherthrough electricity and through chemical signaling,critically rely on having enough sodiumin order to generate what we call action potentialsor electrical firing of neurons.If your sodium levels are too low,your neurons simply won't work.One of the main deficits from being dehydratedis lack of sodium, not just lack of water.Getting sufficient sodium does a number of thingsthat's very important, it can raise your blood volume,it can help you retain water in a healthy way,not excess amounts.It allows neurons to fire for sake of thinking,for sake of athletic performance, and so on.Other electrolytes that are in LMNTare things like magnesium and potassium,which are also essential for neuronal function,and indeed all organ function.LMNT has a lot of salt, some magnesiumand some potassium, so unless you're somebodywho really has chronic hypertension,elevating your level of salt intake can often be beneficial.You should check with your doctor,but indeed it can often be beneficial.LMNT contains a science-backed electrolyte ratioof a 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium.It tastes delicious, I happen to like the raspberryor citrus flavors, in fact, I like all of the flavors.Put in some water, you can make it as dense,meaning as high concentration as you like.So some people will put it in eight ounces of water.I like mine in about 16 ounces of waterand I'll drink that before and after exercise.And I usually will have another one throughout the day,just sip on it as I'm doing work and so forth.If you'd like to try LMNT,you can go to

episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens,now referred to as AG1.I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.The reason I started taking AG1and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a dayis that it helps me meet all of my foundational vitamin,mineral and probiotic needs.And when people ask me, what's the one supplementI should take, if they were to only take one supplement,I always recommend AG1.For the simple reason that the vitamins,the minerals and the probiotic support metabolic health,they support endocrine health, they support brain healthand the probiotics and prebiotics in there in particular,support the so-called gut-brain axis.There is now a plethora of data supporting the factthat when we have a healthy gut microbiome,that has little microbes that live in our gut,that are good for us, our gut signals to our brainand our brain signals back to our gut, in ways that supportour immune system, our digestion, even our mood.They can even support healthy levels of dopamine signaling,an important molecule for motivationand high levels of mood or positive mood.If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,you can go to athleticgreens.com/hubermanto claim a special offer.They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supplyof vitamin D3 K2.Vitamin D3 K2 has been shown to be importantfor metabolic health, endocrine healthand K2 in particular for heart healthand regulating appropriate amounts of calcium in your bones.Again, go to athleticgreens.com/hubermanto claim the special offer.Today's episode is also brought to us by Theragun.Theragun is a handheld percussive devicethat releases deep muscle tension.I was first introduced to Theragun on a shark diving trip.We were way out in the Pacific, filming great white sharksfor my laboratory where we study fear,and everyone was diving all day,carrying what are called Pelican cases,which aren't actual pelicans with wings,but cases for these cameras.They're very heavy, removing things all day,we're working really hard, and we got really sore.I got particularly sore from all that physical labor.Someone brought a Theragun along,I'd never seen one of these things before or tried oneand I spent the rest of the trip trying to get as much timewith the Theragun as I could,at least when I was on board the boat.With Theragun, you can get what is effectivelya deep tissue massage to any area of your body,and you can just do that for minutes or hoursfor as long as you like, it's really wonderful.If you have someone else there,who's willing to use the Theragun on hard to reach placeslike your back, that's even better.Whether or not you want to treat muscle tensionfrom working out and injury or just deal with daily stressfrom everyday life, there's really no substitutefor the Theragun.You know, professional massage is wonderful,but a professional massage of course involvesgoing to a masseuse, it's quite expensive often, et cetera.If you're interested in getting a Theragun,they start at only $199.You can go to Theragun.com/huberman right nowto get your Gen 4 Theragun today.You have a 30-day money back guarantee,that's Theragun.com/huberman.Let's talk about workspace optimization.This is a topic that's intrigued me for a very long timebecause my undergraduate advisor, my graduate advisorand my postdoc advisor had many things in common,including being great scientists, being kind peopleand terrific mentors, but they had another thing in common,which always perplexed me, which is that their officeswere a complete disaster.They had mountains of books, mountains of papers,mountains of all sorts of stuff.And yet all of them were extremely productiveand could remain extremely focusedin that incredibly cluttered environment.Now I'm somebody who doesn't like clutter,I find it very hard to focus in cluttered environments.And indeed there's tremendous variation among peopleas to whether or not they can remain focusedor whether or not they struggle to focusin physically cluttered environments.There's no right or wrong to this,but the question we should ask ourselvesis why were they all able to be so focused?And it turns out that the reason they were ableto be so focused is that they all captured one singleand yet fundamental variable of workspace optimization.And we'll talk about what that variable is.In fact, where you're to talk about what all the variablesof optimizing a workspace are things like vision,things like light, things like noise in the room,whether or not you listen to music or not,whether or not you use noise canceling headphones or not.We're going to talk about all of thatand we're going to do that in a waythat you can optimize your workspace,regardless of whether or not you are at home,whether or not you're on the road, et cetera.Because the last thing I would ever want to dois to create a situation where you findthe optimal workspace, and then you are a slaveto that optimal workspace.That's just not the way the world works.What you want to do or my goal for you rather,is that you will have a short checklist of thingsthat you can look to, anytime you sit down to do work,and you can think about the underlying variablesthat impact your brain and your bodyand allow your brain and body to get into the optimal statein order to learn, in order to be productiveand indeed to move through your work bouts in a very relaxedand pleasureful way while maintaining focusand while pursuing any of the number of thingsthat you're doing.The first variable we want to think aboutin terms of workspace optimization is vision and light.On a previous episode of The Huberman Lab Podcast,devoted all to habits, I talked about the importanceof dividing your 24 hour day into three different phases.And for those of you that haven't heard that episode,I'm just going to briefly summarize what I described.From the time you wake up in the morning until about sixor seven or eight, sometimes nine hours later,your brain is in a unique state.It is in a state of high levels of dopamine,a neuromodulator, and high levels of epinephrin,as well as hormones like cortisol and so forth.Without going into the biology of those things,they set your brain into a state of high alertness.And this is true, whether or notyou indulge in caffeine or not.I know some of you say, oh,I really don't wake up until the afternoon,I'm much more alert and focused in the afternoon.We will talk about that phaseof the 24 hour day in a moment.But that early part of the day is a time of dayin which for sake of workspace optimization,being in a brightly lit environment can lend itselfto optimal work throughout the day,not just during that early phase.And so while on many episodes of this podcast,I've also emphasized the importance of gettingmorning sunlight in your eyeswithin 30 to 60 minutes of waking,not as often, but now, and again, I will also mentionthat it's important to light your daytime environmentas brightly as you safely can.So if you are going to be doing work in this early,what I call phase one portion of your day,you want to have as much light and indeedas much overhead light shining on you as safely possible.And of course you don't want it so bright that it's glaringand you have to squint, et cetera,but you want as much light as is safely possible.And you can do that a couple of simple ways.One is if do own or you're in an environment,we have overhead lights, turn on those overhead lights.What's special about overhead lights for setting alertnessis that the neurons in our eyes, which are calledmelanopsin ganglion cells, that's the fancy name.Melanopsin ganglion cells are mainly enrichedin the lower half of our retinas in our eyesand view the upper visual field.Those neurons send little wires to an areaof our hypothalamus, right above the roof of our mouth,that creates a state of alertness.Now, early in the day, we want to be as alert as possible.And this phase one of our circadian cycleis when we are best at doing analytic detailed type work.So we're going to go into other aspectsof workspace optimization that are important for phase one,but during phase one, again, within zero to about eightor nine hours after waking, bright lightsin your environment, in particular overhead lights,are going to facilitate focus, they're going to facilitatefurther release of things like dopamine and norepinephrineand healthy amounts of cortisol.And we want that to happen early in the dayfor a variety of reasons.For instance, we don't want that cortisol peakto happen too late in the day.That's actually associated with depression and insomniaand a number of things that we just don't want.So one of the things that I've done for my workspaceis to make sure that when I wake up in the morning,I do go get my sunlight.If the sun isn't out, I turn onas many bright artificial lights as I can manageor tolerate, and then I go get my sunlight exposure.But once I set out to do some workthat all the overhead lights in that room are on,as well as lights in front of me.And that's again to stimulate heightened levels of focusand further release of these neuromodulatorsthat I mentioned before, dopamine,norepinephrine and epinephrine.Now the way that one could do thatcould be a very low cost way of having, for instance,a desk lamp and those overhead lights.If you're somebody that wants to take thisto the next level, you can purchase a ring light, which is,I think those are mainly made for peopledoing selfie type videos, for Instagram postsand things of that sort.Ring lights can be pretty cost-effective,and yet they're very bright and they have the sort of brightblue light that is going to optimally stimulatethose melanopsin ganglion cells.So some people I know will have a blue lightor a bright LED on their desk in front of them.And indeed I have one of these, I don't use a ring light,I use a light pad.The particular light pad I use, I bought on Amazon.I can mention the brand, but again,I have no financial affiliation to them,this is the Artograph Lightpad is designed for drawing.And it says on it 930 lux,Lux is just a measure of brightness.So I place that on the desk in front of me and I turn it onessentially throughout this phase one of the day.Even if I walk away from the desk, I tend to keep it on,it doesn't consume that much energy.And in that way, I'm constantly being bombarded with photonsthat keep my levels of alertness upbecause the early part of the dayis when I do the majority of that focused work.Again, you don't need the light pad,you can use a ring light, or you can simply useany kind of other lightsthat you might happen to have artificial lights.For those of you that can place your desk near a window,and even better to open the window,that would be really fantastic.I don't have access to that.Why would I say open the window?Well, it turns out that sunlightis going to be the best stimulus for waking up your brainand body through this melanopsin hypothalamus system.And by looking at sunlight through a window,it's 50 times less effective than if that windowwere to be open, mostly because those windows filter outa lot of the wavelengths of blue lightthat are essential for stimulating the eyesand this wake-up signal.So all of this has rests on the premisethat we need to be alert in order to do our work,in particular focused work.And I've talked about before in the Habits episode,and I'm saying again now, that first phase of the day,that first seven or eight or nine hours of the dayis really the time in which our neurochemistryis primed for getting the most amountof focused kind of challenging work donewhere a lot of precision and detail is required.So you want to brightly light your work environmentduring that first phase, again, from the time you wake up,try and get sunlight, but then even if you're goingto get exercise or do other things,you want to get as much bright light in your eyesas you safely canand then you want to light your work environment.Now in the afternoon, starting at about nineand continuing until about 16 hours after waking,you want to start dimming the lights in that environment.Now you don't want to make it darkbecause you don't want to get sleepyat two o'clock in the afternoon,unless you're going to take a brief nap,which I do and is perfectly fine,as long as it doesn't interfere with your nighttime sleep.But the idea is that in this so-called phase twoof the 24 hour cycle from about nine to 16 hoursafter waking, you want to bringthe level of lights down a bit.And when I say down, I literally mean down.Having lights that are in front of you is fine,but overhead lights at that time are not going to be optimalfor the sorts of neurochemical statesthat your brain wants to be in.The states that I'm referring to are a shiftfrom the dopamine and norepinephrinethat's highest early in the day to increasesin things like serotonin and other neuromodulatorsthat put your brain into a state that's betterfor creative endeavors or for more abstract thinking.Now, as we'll soon see, there are other things you can doto improve creative thinking and abstract thinking.And in fact, there are things you can doto improve analytic thing, and we will talk about those,things that are distinct from light,but right now we're just focusing on light.So what I recommend doing, and what I personally dois I will turn off overhead lights in the afternoon.It's not completely dim, it's not completely dark,but I will start to reduce the amount of overhead lightand just simply keep the light pad onand whatever other lamps I happen to be using.Now, one thing we haven't talked about is screen brightness.This is highly individual,people have different retinal sensitivities.What I mean by that is everybody differsin terms of how bright they can toleratetheir visual environment and their screen.And whether or not you are sensitive to light or not,will depend on a lot of factors.Some of it is eye color,indeed people with darker color eyesgenerally can tolerate more bright light than others.I have green eyes, I am very, very sensitive to light.If I'm outdoors at a cafe or something,and the table has any kind of reflective propertiesand it's a sunny day, I can barely see the personacross the table from me, unless I'm wearing sunglasses.Some people, other members of my family for instance,have dark brown eyes and can just sit thereand have a conversation without the needfor sunglasses at all.So that's, there's tremendous variation there,one or the other isn't healthy or advantageous necessarily,just understand that you never want to be in an environmentwhere it's painful to maintain looking at whatever it isthat you're looking at.If something's painful to look at,it could be damaging to your eyes,so you do want to protect your eyes.Now, in this second phase of the day,since most of us are working indoors,but even if you're working outdoors,you want to try and get the amount of light reduced overall,but in particular, that overhead light,and you also want to start reducingthe amount of blue light that you're being exposed to.So somewhere around four or 5:00 pm,which for me is about 12 hours after I've been awakeor 14 hours after I've been awake,I will turn off that light pad and start to transitionthe lights in my environment to more yellows and reds.Now, I can't always do this, I have friends that actuallyhave converted their entire homes from blue lightearly in the day to red light late in the day,that's really cool and fantastic, I haven't done that.There's a cost to doing that and it is optimalin terms of optimizing productivity and sleep and so forth,but it's not feasible for a lot of people.But what I do is I simply switch to using yellow lamps.I will turn off that LED in the later afternoon,again, around four or 5:00 pm, and I tend to wake uparound 6:00 am or so, I'll turn those off.And what I'll try and do also is I'll try and dim the screenthat I'm working on so that I can still manageto see everything that I need to see,but it's quite a bit dimmer than it was early in the day.So that's phase two of the day,and that's how we want to think about light.And then I'll just mention, because I know there are peoplewho are working in the middle of the night,there's phase three,which is about 17 to 24 hours after waking.And I realize that for shift workers or for peoplethat are pulling all nighters or for students,oftentimes you need to be awake and studyingin the middle of the night.I, myself am somebody who for years would pull anywherefrom five to 10 all-nighters per year.I still pull an all nighter now, and again,because of deadlines and so forth.I don't recommend it, if you can avoid it, great,but many people just simply have to do thisfor sake of shift work or because of impending deadlinesor procrastination or all of the above.If you are going to be doing work in that third phaseof your circadian cycle, you really want to limitthe amount of bright light that you're getting in your eyesto just the amount that allows you to do the workthat you're doing.Because if you get light in your eyes,that's any brighter than that,you're going to severely deplete your melatonin levels.You're going to severely shift your circadian clockand it's effectively like traveling to another time zone.So if you stay up from 3:00 am until 6:00 amor 2:00 am until 4:00 am working on a term paperor something of that sort,and you're getting bright light in your eyes,you are effectively flying six hoursto a different time zone,or at least that's what your body registers it as.And it can really throw your sleep and your metabolismand a number of other things out of whack.Now there's an exception to this,which is if you really want to be awake,it can often be beneficial to flipping on all the lightsin the room and keeping them really bright.One of the hardest things to do is to stay up all nightstudying when you're in a dim environment.So you have to determine the trade offbetween whether or not you want to shift your clockor whether or not you want to get the work done.And I would say the ideal situation is to sleep at nightand to do your work during the day and in the afternoon,but if you do have to be awake in the middle of the night,do understand that you want to dim those lights overall.You would not want to use that LED,you would not want to have overhead lights on,unless you're really struggling to stay awake,in which case you want to getas many bright lights on as possible.So there are a couple of tricks to all-nighters,I don't really want people pulling all-nightersunless they have to, but there are a few thingsthat you can do without taking stimulantsin order to stay up all night, that can be beneficialthat maximize on your biology.One of them that's a little less commonly knownis you can drink 32 ounces of water and committo not going to the bathroom for 90 minutes, at least.It turns out that there is a circuitthat goes from your bladder, literally neuronsthat go from your bladder to your brainstemand when you have to urinate, it makes you very alert.And as many of you have probably experienced,this is actually what wakes us upin the middle of the night when we have to use the bathroomis this circuit for alertness that goes from full bladder,it's signaled by the bladder being full to the brainstem.And this is the circuit that is disruptedin kids that have bedwetting issues.And there are a number of cognitive behavioral approachesto that, sometimes bedwetting in very young kidsis because the circuit hasn't developed yet.Most adults fortunately are not bedwetting,but you can increase the amount of alertness in your systemand remain awake in the middle of the night,by drinking a little bit more water than you normally wouldand then refraining from going to the restroom,that certainly will lend itself to alertness.You know how difficult it is to fall asleepwhen you have to use the restroom for instance.So that's one tool.The other thing is again, to flip on as many bright lightsin the environment as possible.And then of course, people will rely on stimulantslike caffeine or even more aggressive stimulants.That's not something I necessarily recommend,you'll each have to determine that for you.But if you do in fact, have to use all-nightersfor any reason, you can maximizethis bladder to brain approach and the right light approach.So that more or less covers how bright to keepyour overall environment and how bright to keep your screen.If you really want to get nerdy about this,there is a free app called Light Meter where you can startmeasuring how many lux, how many photonsare in a given environment.It's actually measuring reflectance of photons and so on,if you can look up what a Lux Meter does, if you like,I don't necessarily recommend doing that.I don't want to set a critical threshold by which,for instance, we say, once your environmentis more than 1,500 lux, then it's too brightor not bright enough, et cetera.Everyone has different retinal sensitivities,everyone will find that different levels of brightnesswill cause them to be alert, different levels of dimness,if you will, in the room will cause them to feel sleepy.You really want to just modulate across the 24 hour cyclewhere it's very bright, as bright as safely can beearly in the day so that you are alert.You can do your focus detailed work in that first phase,and then in the afternoon, as you moveinto more creative type works or abstract thinking,or working with other people in kind of a brainstorming modethat you would shift to dimmer lights, yellow lights,eliminate the blue lights as much as possible.Now that's light, but there's another aspect of visionthat has been shown to be critically importantfor how alert we are going to beand how well we can maintain that alertness.And that has to do with where our visual focus isin a given environment.So I'm not talking about overall brightness,what I'm referring to now is simplywhere you place your phone or your tabletor computer screen or book,whatever it is that you happen to be looking at.There's a very underappreciated and yet incredible aspectof our neurology that has to do with the relationshipbetween where we look and our level of alertness.And it works in a very logical way,we have clusters of neurons in our brain stemand those clusters of neurons control our eyelid musclesand they control our eye movements up and downinto the sides.And indeed, if you were to look at an eyeball,I looked at a lot of eyeballs in my laband I teach neural anatomy, so we do this from time to time,we would see that there are six musclesattached to your eyeball.Now four of them are located at the top, the bottomand the two sides of your eyeball,sort of at the 12 o'clock, six o'clock, three o'clockand nine o'clock of your eyeball.And those muscles can move your eye in the socketfrom side to side and up and down.And then we also have some musclesthat can actually pull the eyeballs at angles.So we have different muscles that can move the eyesat different angles as well, and that's why we can lookup into the side or down into the side,not just from side to side or up or down.Now, the neurons that control those muscleshave a very interesting feature,which is that when we are looking down toward the groundor anywhere below, basically the central region of our face,the neurons that control that eye movementare intimately related to areas of the brainstemthat release certain types of neuromodulatorsand neurotransmitters.And they activate areas of the brain that are associatedwith calm and indeed, even with sleepinessand there's an active inhibition or preventionof neurons that increase alertness.Now the opposite is also true, we have neuronsthat place our eyes into an upward gazeabove the sort of level of our noseand up above our forehead.Literally looking up while keeping the head stationary,or if you tilt your head back and you look up,these neurons are still active.Those neurons don't just control the position of the eyesand cause them to move up, they also trigger the activationof brain circuits that are associated with alertness.Now, this is a fundamental feature of the way that our eyesand brain are wired together and how they relateto what we call autonomic arousal.And there are a bunch of details there.We will actually have a guest in a few weeks who has learnedto exploit these neurons and the fact that they controlthese different states of calm or alertnessin order to generate hypnotic states, to place peopleinto very atypical states in which they are bothvery alert and very calm.We'll save that for a future episode.But the important thing to understandis when you are looking down below the level of your nose,you are essentially decelerating your alertness.You're reducing your amount of alertness,it might be subtle, but it's happening.Whereas when you look straight ahead or in particular,when you look up, you're increasing your level of alertness.Now this has some obvious implications.When we get sleepy, our eyelids tend to closeand we tend to nod down, when we're wide awake,we tend to be wide-eyed, we don't tend to blink as often.And we tend to be chin up and kind of on vigilanceand alertness.So this has a evolutionary,or at least an adaptive component to it.This can be exploited, and indeed it's been researchedin terms of how it can be usedto optimize work environments.Contrary to what most people do,which is to look down at their laptop, tablet, or phone,if you want to be alert and you want to maintainthe maximum amount of focus for whatever it isthat you're reading or doing, you want that screenor whatever it is that you're looking atto at least be at eye level and ideally slightly above it.Now, I haven't seen many workspaces that take advantageof this very hardwired neuro-biological fact.So what should you do with this information?Well, if you're somebody who sits down to do workand starts to feel sleepy, or simply unfocused,unable to attend to whatever it is that you're doing,I highly recommend that you take your laptop or tablet.I do hope that most people aren't doing serious workon their phones because it's such a small visual window,and we can talk about why that's an issue later.And the idea would be to place that screen of your tabletor your laptop or other computer,and try and get it elevated at least to nose level,your nose level, or even higher.Now I realize that can be complicated to do,I've long, just used a stack of books,or I'll sometimes take a box and turn upside downand set it there.I do use a mixed standing-seated desk,I'll talk about that in a few minutes.There are a number of different ways that you could do this,you could wall mount a monitor.I think many people are working with laptops,it's a little bit harder to do that with a laptop,some people though will configure a second screen.You have to decide what's right for you in your budget.But again, in addition to having a brightly lit room,to be able to focus and attend to whatever it isyou're working on, you want to have that screenpositioned high in your visual environment.Now you wouldn't want it on the ceiling necessarily,I know that would be pretty cool,but you do want it above you.Now, there are a couple solutions to this that don't involvea wall mount or stacking books or boxes.For instance, you could be one of those peoplethat likes to lie in bed or on the sofaand get your screen up above youby putting pillows on your knees.I used to actually do a lot of my writing and workin the middle of the night, I don't do this anymoreand I don't recommend it, but I used to doa lot of work from bed.Now I no longer bring electronics for work into the bedroom.I just really try and keep the bedroom for sleepingor whatever else.But in terms of lying down on the couch,it is somewhat easier to get that screen up above you,you can kind of slide underneath that screen and get typing,but there's a problem with that.And we'll talk about this a little bit more in a moment,but it turns out that your posture,literally the position of your body relative to gravity,also has important implications for how alert you are.So ideally you would be standing or seated.I would say the ideal would be standing,second best will be seated and your screen will beeither directly in front of you or slightly above you.Or if you wanted to get really fancy,you could create a situation where it was above youand slightly tilted toward you so that you actuallyhad to maintain kind of proper neck posture.This accomplishes a number of things.In addition to making you more alert,you also get away from the so-called text neck.You know, people are starting to look morelike C's nowadays, the shape of the letter Cbecause we're constantly looking down.I do every once in a while, see somebody who's textingin public with it at eye level, it always looks a little oddthat they're doing that, but I always admire their postureat the same time, so we shouldn't give them a hard time.So this is another feature that you can arrangeinto your physical workspace.Again, whether or not you're seated or you're standingthroughout the day, try and get that screen elevated.Now with reference to posture, there are beautiful dataillustrating that when we are standing up,those same neurons in our brainstem,locus coeruleus neurons, which release I should mentionthings like norepinephrin and epinephrin,those neurons become active when we are standing.They become even more active when we are ambulatory,when we are moving and we will talk about treadmillingand cycling at your desk and so forth in a little bit.But when you sit, they become a little less activeand when you lie down and indeed, any time that you startto get your feet up above your waistor your head tilted back, those neurons fire lessand neurons in your brain that are involved in calming,and indeed putting you to sleep,start increasing their level of firing.It's a really beautiful system.So beautiful, in fact, that there are studiesthat show that as you adjust the angle of the body back,you actually get a sort of dose-dependent increasein sleepiness and calmnessand a dose-dependent decrease in alertness.And so, as we were all told to sit up straightor even better, just stand up straight,and now I'm also telling you to get that visual thingthat you're attending to, screen or otherwise,up in front of you, or ideally above you,those things combine to generate maximum alertness.So you can think about how you might work thisinto various aspects of your homework environmentor office work environment.But as I describe this, many of you are probably thinkingwhat I'm thinking, which is, gosh, most of what we dois in complete opposite directionto all of this neurobiologically grounded advice.Most of us are looking down at our laptop while seated,or we are lying down, which is going to make us more sleepy,or we are positioning our computers in front of us,but we really aren't an environment that's bright enoughand so on and so forth.So as you can tell, we're starting to layer inthe various things that you can do,first brightness in the room, second, get that screen upand try and put yourself into a posture for workthat lends itself or promotes alertnessif indeed, you want to be alert for that work.If your goal is to take a nap, get your feet elevatedabout 10 to 15 degrees above your head,maybe put a pillow underneath it, lie down and take a nap,but that's not what we're talking about today,we're talking about workspace optimization.And I suppose you could also exploit that all-nighter trickthat I talked about earlier, I actually did this,when I was an undergraduate,I was a little bit masochistic in this way.I would drink coffee and water at fairly high volume.I wasn't forced drinking or anything like that,but I actually wouldn't allow myself to get upand use the bathroom except on a timer.So I think the longest ever went was three and a half hours.It was kind of excruciating, I actually don't thinkthat's necessarily a healthy advice, but again,you can use slight, I mentioned slight over consumptionof fluids in order to generate alertness.That was just me really trying to get as much work doneas I could, I had a very, very demanding class scheduleand it was just the only way that I could get work done.If I was getting up every few minutes, use the restroom,I found it hard to re-engage in that workand maintain focus,which is what I just want to briefly mention now.I talked about this in the episode on focus,but one thing that is completely unreasonableand that you should never ask yourself to dois to sit down or stand up and immediately focuson something, unless you're stressedabout what you're looking at,or you're very, very excited by it.If you're very stressed about some sort of informationor a deadline, or you're very, very excited about something,you'll find that you can focus instantlyjust within a moment.And that's because of the deployment of neurochemicalslike dopamine and norepinephrinethat bring about our levels of alertness.However, most of us, including myself,will go to begin to work out and we'll find that our minddoesn't quite engage at the level of depth and focusthat we would like right off the bat.I've timed this and other studies have timed thisin a more rigorous way, mine is just what we call anecdata,but so I've timed it for myself,but there are studies that have looked at this.And the data point to the factthat even at our most heightened levels of focus,most people can only maintain focus before switching tasksfor about three minutes,which is depressingly short period of time.However, you can extend that period of time,and I've talked about that in the episode on focus,but more importantly, when you sit down to start a work aboutof any kind, any kind expect that it would takeabout six minutes for you to engage these neural circuits,you wouldn't expect yourself to walk into the gymand do a PR lift or start running and do your best sprint,or just head out the door without warming up at all.A little walk jog at first, or a few warm up sets,I mean, we expect that, we are not surprisedthat we need that.And yet we sort of expect that our brain should be ableto lock on and do work in a very focused way immediately.And that's just a ridiculous assumption,it's an unfair assumption, I should say.So assume that it will take about six minutes to engagein your work about and that those neurochemical systemswill take some time to rev up and engage.The other things that I'm describing about lightingand screen positioning and posture,those will also help maximize your focusand will limit that ramp up time into a focus state.And I think what you'll find is that as you maximizeyour workspace, the time the latency,as we say to get into that focus will start to shorten.It will especially start to shorten if you use toolsto limit distraction, we will talk about distraction,but things like Freedom, which is an app,a free app that allows you to lock yourselfout of the internet or turning off your phone for instance.But even if you're doing work on your phone or that involvesyour phone or the internet, as many of usincluding myself do, expect there to be a ramp up timefor you to focus.There's another aspect of our visionthat's absolutely critical for optimizing our workspace.And that has to do with this really interesting featureof our visual pathways in that it has two major channels.Those two major channels have names,although you don't have to remember the names.The first one is the so-called parvocellular channel,which is involved in looking at things at specific pointsin space and at high resolution or detail.And then there's the so-called magnocellular channel,that's involved in looking at big swaths of visual spaceand at lower resolution.So you can think of the parvocellular systemas kind of a high pixel density,think about your most modern smartphone,the recent smartphone with the best, best camera.And think about the magnocellular systemas being lower resolution, kind of an older smartphone,lower pixels, et cetera.You might ask, why would you want a systemthat's low resolution.Well, the low resolution system is better at thingslike detecting motion and not so much at detailand vice versa.Now, again, you don't have to remember the names,what you do have to remember, however,is that you're going to create the maximum amountof alertness in your system.The maximum amount of ability to focus when your systemis in that parvocellular mode,when you're bringing your eyes to a common point,what we call a vergence eye movement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E.I've said this before on the podcast, and people said,virgin eye movement, no, vergence eye movement.As in convergence, bringing your eyesto a single point in space, will create a narrower apertureof a visual window, meaning your visual worldactually shrinks at least perceptually.Whereas when you relax your eyes and dilate your gaze,you can do this now by whatever environment you're in,trying and see without moving your head off to the side,above, below you, as broadly as possible,maybe can dilate your gaze so much that you can seeyourself, your body in that visual environment.You'll notice that your resolution of visionisn't nearly as high as when you dothat vergence eye movement.Vergence eye movements are incredibly powerfulfor creating heightened states of alertness and focus.And indeed they create heightened states of cognition,of thinking, and that's because your brainfollows your vision in terms of focus.When we say I can't focus, what we often are experiencingis an ability, and inability, excuse me,to not focus visually.Whereas when we are in a very focused state,we are in a state often where we can focus visually.Now we can also do this with our auditory systemor to touch et cetera, but right now we're just talkingabout the visual system.Now, in terms of workspace optimization,what this means is we never really want to be lookingat a square or rectangle or target area for our workthat is too far beyond our ears.How far is too far?Really, you want to try and keep the blinders on,or I should say the invisible blindersso that whatever you're looking at fallswithin the region of visual space in front of you,that is present if you were to cup your handsand put them right next to your eyes.Now this is a rough estimation, but I'm doing this now,for those of you that are watching on YouTube,I'm doing this now, I'm trying to simulate like a horsewith blinders on, for those of you who are listening,just imagine me looking silly with my handscupped near my eyes.But if we are to, for instance, look at a screenthat's very, very big and we're too close to it,or even if we're standing back from it,it's going to be hard for us to attend to everythingwithin that screen space.So this is actually support for the idea of using a phoneor a tablet or a laptop.My laptop is about 15 inches in diameter,I think is the one that I have, some are 13, some are 17.Some of you like to use big monitors,make sure that whatever it is that you're looking at,if you want to remain focused, it doesn't extend too farbeyond where your eyes are, the size of your head that is,so just think blinders on a horse.And actually that's the reason they put blinders on a horseso that they're not looking off into the periphery.Horses, unlike humans don't have the same shaped pupil,they don't have a visual systemthat's organized in quite the same way,they mostly see in Panorama, in magnocellular vision.And so those blinders are designedto keep their visual focus straight ahead,so they physically restrict it.Now, some people will actually go to lengthsto further restrict their visual focus.They will do things like putting on a hoodieor wearing a hat for instance,to restrict their visual window.And indeed that works quite well,but as we'll talk about in a momentwhen you really restrict your visual window,down to a very, very narrow portion of visual space,that actually changes the types of informationthat you are best at processing.And we'll talk about that in terms of somethingthat's called the cathedral effect in a few moments,but for now here's the principle,make sure that whatever you're looking atis directly in front of you and doesn't extendtoo far out to the side.Once you get out to say six or 12 or certainly 18 incheson side of your eyes, you are dilating your gazeby definition, you're dilating your gaze,it's completely subconscious, and it becomes very hardto maintain attention.Now, the caveat to this is that if you are going to lookat a narrow space, a narrow window for any period of time,whether or not it's a book or a laptopor a tablet or a phone, those vergence eye movementsnot only create alertness, but they also require energy.And they also can fatigue the eyes because there's a processcalled accommodation whereby the shape of your eyeliterally has to change so that the lens can moveso that you can focus at that location.Accommodation's an incredible process,but it is as demanding one, and that's the reasonthat your eyes get tired when you focus on somethingfor too long.So here's a principle extracted from the ophthalmologyand neuroscience literature that you can adopt.For every 45 minutes in which you are focusing on somethinglike a phone or a tablet or a book page or your computer,you want to get into magnocellular panoramic visionfor at least five minutes.And the way that I suggest to do this is actuallyto take a walk, ideally outside.We're going to talk about ambulation, about movementand about how that can maintain alertnessthroughout the day.So for every 45 minutes or so, try and get five minutesof relaxing your eyes.This is something that's not often done,especially in today's homeschoolingand where kids are going to school by Zoomand adults are working by Zoom, this is a serious problem.People are getting eye fatigue, they're getting headaches.Indeed, some people are getting migraines,they're having all sorts of issues, neck pain.Much of that, if not all of that, in some casescan be alleviated by this 45 to five rule.For every 45 minutes of focused work that you do,get five minutes where you get outside,or if you have to be indoors where you can dilate your gaze.Now some of you may be saying,well, that spits in the face of your 90 minute rule.You've told us before that we should focus for 90 minutes.I would still want you to take breakswithin those 90 minutes, if you're looking at a narrow pieceof visual world, meaning at a phone or a laptop or so forth,and again, the best way to do this would be to go outside,just relax your eyes, look off into the distance.Looking at a horizon will automatically triggerthis panoramic gaze, which is very relaxing to the eyesand will allow you to go back into a focused work about.The one thing you absolutely do not want to dois to go outside and check your phone,because if you're outside checking your phoneor you're taking a break and checking your phone,you're still in that vergence eye movement.So this is very, very importantbecause vergence eye movements increase focus and attention,and you can exploit that to increase focusand attention when you want to, but you absolutely needto relax the system, again for every 45 minutesin which you've been in that focused mode,you want to get at least five minutes of panoramic vision.If you can take a 15 minute walk, even better.Next, I'd like to talk about an aspectof workspace optimization that can actually biaswhether or not our brain and nervous systemare better suited for detailed analytic workor more abstract work.In fact, there's a way that you can arrangeyour work environment, or I should say there's a waythat you can place yourself into certain environmentsthat will allow abstract thinking, creative thinking,and indeed expansive thinking to emerge.There are other environments that you can put yourself inthat will make your brain shift towards more analytic work,toward more detailed and precise types of work.Now, I just briefly want to mention something that was coveredagain on the Habits episode that I did a few weeks ago,but again, you don't need to see that episodein order to digest this information.It goes back to this issue of three phaseswithin the circadian 24 hour cycle.Phase one, which as I mentioned is about zero to eight hoursafter waking, phase two, nine to 16 hours after waking,and phase three 17 to 24 hours after waking.Phase one, being ideal for analytic precise,detailed types of work, phase two, better suitedfor most people for creative, kind of abstract thinking,expansive thinking, brainstorming, et cetera.There are some exceptions to that, but most people followthat pattern because of the different neuromodulatorsand hormones and so forth that are releasedinto the brain and body at those different phases.What I'm about to tell you is a way in which you can useyour physical environment to further shift your brainand nervous system into a mode that's either primefor analytic or abstract and creative thinking.What I'm about to describe is called the cathedral effect.The cathedral effect has been discussed well really,for many, many decades, maybe even hundreds of years,but formally has been discussed since the early 2000sin which it seemed that people who werein high ceilinged environments, hence the phrase cathedral,would shift their thinking and their ideas to more abstractand creative lofty type thinking.So literally higher ceiling, loftier thinking,higher aspirations that this was observedin terms of the language that they use,but also the sorts of ideas that they would generate.And conversely, that people that werein lower ceilinged environments would be more orientedtoward using a language that was more restricted,literally more detailed, analytic about thingsin their immediate space.Now this seems kind of wild on the one hand,but actually if we go back to our understandingof the neurobiology of the visual systemand the way that our brain and body is evolvedin different environments, it actually makes a lot of sense.We don't have time to go into a long lectureabout evolutionary neurobiology, but we have to rememberthat our nervous system has a number of featuresthat are adapted to different environments.And indeed, we are able to go from big open prairiesor mountaintops or large cathedrals or concert hallsinto small environments and everything scales with it.When we're outdoors in a big, expensive space,our vision tends to go long, we tend to be in panoramic,magnocellular vision.Our hearing tends to extend long,even if we're having a conversation with somebody,we tend to also be attending somewhatto the screech of hawks off in the distanceor to the rush of a river.Whereas when we were in small spaces, everything,our vision, our hearing, and indeedeven our physical movements become more restrained.Even if we can still extend our hands out as far as we want.What do I mean by that?Let's say you're in an elevator,that's a small space compared to outside on a field.This has been measured over and over again.The size or the amplitude of people's spontaneous movementsactually scales down in smaller environments,even if they aren't completely restricted from extendingtheir limbs all the way, whereas when we are outdoors,we feel a natural impulse to move further awayfrom our body, our torso with our limbs,this just feels like more appropriate behavior.And when I say appropriate,I don't mean in any kind of social context necessarily.There's actually a reason for this, the visual systemand the so-called vestibular motor systemare intimately linked.And I can just tell you briefly one wayin which you can test this and observe thisand even use this, it's a little off topicfrom today's episode, but let's sayyou have a certain amount of flexibility.You can extend your arms off like wingsis what I'm doing for those of you that are listening,not watching off to your side with arms straight,and you reach a maximum positioning of flexibility.You can do a quick experiment where you sit still,you would bring your arms in for a moment.You can put them on your knees, if you like,or in front of you, and you can move your eyesvery far off into the periphery of your visual field.So you actually, I'm going to do this now.It looks kind of silly, but moving my eyeswithout moving my head off into the periphery,all the way to the right, then all the way to the left,all the way up all the way down,but especially all the way to the left,almost looking over my shoulder without turning my headall the way to my right.And you will find that you actually can extend your armsfurther back subsequent to that.And that's not magic, it has to do with the waysin which your cerebellum, which actually means mini brainand your eyes, your visual system are connected,and the way in which your cerebellum controlssome of the spindles and other aspectsof the neuromuscular architecture of your nervous system,'cause your nerves control your musclesand allow those muscles to move further out.So for those of you that lack flexibility,you can actually explore your visual system for this.Now that's again, a bit of a tangent, but it's a fun onethat relates back to this so-called cathedral effect.The cathedral effect is a way in which our thinkingbecomes more restricted and restrained in tighter,smaller, more confined visual environments.Or if the ceiling is higher, we are in expansive spacewith a lot of distance above us or space above usand out to the sides, maybe even out on a field,our thinking goes into these more broad abstractand kind of loftier future thinking in particular.This has actually been measured.There's a really nice paper, I will post a link to this.The authors are Joan Meyers-Levy and Rui,and then in parentheses Juliet Zhu,I'm going to assume that they go by Juliet.The title of the paper is "The Influence of Ceiling Height:"The Effect of Priming"on the Type of Processing People Use."And I won't go into all the detailsof this paper, but what's really cool about this paperis they looked with very rigorous statisticsand they have a fair number of subjectsand everything about this paper looks solid to me.The difference in cognitive processing,and abstract thinking and detailed analytic workthat people are able to perform in environmentsthat have a 10 foot ceiling versus an eight foot ceiling,which is not that much of a difference,there's just two foot difference there.And what they found were significant effectswhereby high ceilings, activate conceptsrelated to abstraction, whereas low ceilings primeconfinement related concepts, but, or promotethe kind of detailed thinking that lends itself wellto sort of spreadsheet type work or accounting type work.Whereas abstract creative work was supportedby these higher ceilings.And the way they analyze this was really interesting.Again, we don't have time to go into all the details,but they ask people to sort of generate word setsof related to particular topics like sports.And so people will talk about soccer, football,baseball, golf, et cetera,and talk about some of the equipment and other things.And then they had a kind of a challenge,a cognitive challenge whereby people had to linkdifferent concepts along different dimensionsso that you depart from the dimension of sportand you start thinking about sports that involve teamsor sports that involve a ball, et cetera.And so in the same conditions you can,except for the fact that the ceiling height is differenteight feet or 10 feet, what one findsis that the kinds of language and the kinds of associationsthat people start to create are vastly different.And there're actually two experiments in this study,you're welcome to go look at it,so it wasn't just about sports, there were some other thingsthat were analyzed as well.And in the references of this paper,it also points to other examples of the cathedral effect,which I find very interesting because as a vision scientistand someone who spends his life thinking aboutand indeed talking about the nervous system,we know that our cognition follows our vision.For low vision or blind people will follow mostlytheir hearing and to some extent their touch.But for most people who are sighted,as most people are cited,our cognition follows our visual environment.So what does this mean for workspace optimization?Well, most of us have a fixed ceiling level in our home,but you might have rooms in which the ceiling is higherand rooms in which the ceiling is lower.If that were the case, I recommend if you want to docreative work during phase two, the nine to 16 hoursof your circadian cycle, nine to 16 hours after wakingthat is, that you do that in the high ceiling room,or maybe even outdoors out on a deck or on a patio.Cause the highest ceiling of courses is the sky.Whereas if you're going to do detailed analytic workI would suggest doing that during phase one of the day.But even if you're going to do it during phase twoof the day, for whatever reason, schedulingor other sorts of constraints that you do thatin the lower ceiling environment.Now, if you are interested in controllingthe height of your visual world, but you don't have controlover the ceiling height of the environment that you're in,there's another way to do that.And I used to observe this in the cafes,in and around Stanford, and the Bay areawhere you would see somebody who, despite the weatherwould be in a hoodie, maybe with a baseball capor other form of hat or some sort of blinderabove their eyebrows, which is actually another wayof just lowering the ceiling height very, very lowand restricting your visual field.Not unlike blinders that we talked about beforethat one would put on a horse or one would put on themselvesby restricting their visual angle of focusto directly in front of them, but not too far outbeyond the sides of their head.So these cathedral effects, I think can be leveragedtoward doing particular types of work best.And again, the lower the ceilingor the lower your visual environment,the more that one tends to do where I should say performsdetailed analytic work accurately.And the more that one's thinking is orientedtowards detailed sort of correct answer type work.Whereas when the ceiling is higher or there's no ceiling,the more that the brain and the rest of the processingthat we call cognitive processing,is related to abstract reasoning, brainstorming,and indeed can pull from broader swaths of memory resources,because really what abstract reasoning is,is it's taking the existing elements and maneuvering them,arranging them into novel ways.So you can think about like notes on a piano,playing a particular song, learning scales,that's very analytic.There's a correct answer that you're trying to arrive ator generate, whereas writing music or writing poetryor generating new material of any kind,involves taking existing elements, right?You're not going to use words that you don't havecommitted to your memory or that you're not aware of,and arranging them in novel ways.So I think the cathedral effect can be leveraged.And again, you don't need to move into a different homeor build a slanted roof and work at one side of the roomat one part of the day and the other side of the roomat the other, although if that's the way you want to swing it,that's great, most of us don't have that flexibility,but it's very clear that the height of the ceilingof the visual environment that we're in,has a profound effect on the types of cognitive processesthat we are able to engage.Now, I'd like to shift our attentionto the auditory environment or the noise in the roomor the music in the room or the musicor noise in the headphones, because it turns outthat there is a lot of quality scientific data out therethat speaks to whether or not listening to particular soundscan enhance our cognition.And indeed the answer is yes,but there are very particular types of things to listen tounder very particular types of conditionsthat allow one to do that.First off, I want to say that people vary tremendouslyin the extent to which they can toleratebackground noise for work.In fact, individuals will vary tremendously from one dayto the next, or even within the same dayin the extent to which they can tolerate background noise.I've experienced this myself, there been timesin which I've been working at homeand I felt like for whatever reason,I just could not engage in focus.And what worked to generate more focus for mewas to go to a cafe or to a libraryor someplace where there's actually more commotion,more people moving about, maybe even more noise,maybe even music in the room.And we have to all be in touch with when we wantmore background noise, or when we wantless background noise, there is no hard and fast rule.If you look across the literature for studies that involvecomplete silence or white noise or binaural beats, or musicor classical music or rock and roll,you can find results to support any type of environmentas being more beneficial.However, as we'll talk about in a moment,there are a few types of environments to really avoidand a few types of sounds that really can enhancethe cognition and your ability to focusin your workspace environment across the board,that really seemed to work for all people.Let's talk about background noise to avoid.And here we're talking about background noise to avoidbecause it actually can causesome pretty severe deficits in cognition.There's a paper first author, Jordan Love, cool name,last author Alexander Francis.The, the title of the paper has to dowith "Psychophysiological responses to potentially annoying"heating, ventilation and air conditioning noise"during mentally demanding work," which is a mouthful.But basically what this paper identifies is a large datasetin which workplace and environmental noise,mostly the humming of air conditioners that's very loudor the humming of heaters, that's very loud and ongoing,just incessant doesn't let up, can really increasemental fatigue and can vastly decreasecognitive performance. And if you're interested in lookingat the cognitive performance data that authorsare Banbury & Berry 2005, that paper is the onethat supports the fact that cognitive performance is worsewhen there's just the hum of an air conditionerin the background or the hum of a heaterand otherwise complete silence.There's also evidence which I discussed on the episodeabout hearing, which is that in young children,white noise can cause some impairmentsin the development of the auditory system.Now I don't want parents to freak out and if you're exposedto white noise, as it as a sleep aid as a child,which I know many of you were, don't freak out,but it turns out that white noise, especially if it's loud,white noise can cause some disruption in the auditory maps,the representation of different frequencies of soundin the brain that can lead to some deficits in auditoryand even language processing.So we really have to be careful about long-term exposure,extended exposure to white noise,or kind of an air conditioning noisethat's really at a high level.I wouldn't worry if it's in the background and shutting offand turning on again, as the thermostat kicks off and on,but really try and avoid work in loud fan filledor ventilation generating or heat generating environments,because it really can cause damageto the auditory system long-term and as we described,it can impair cognitive performanceand overall increase fatigue.I think we've all experienced that when you're in a roomand there's some ongoing background noiseand all of a sudden it stops and you just feelthis enormous relief [sighs].And the reason for this is that our auditory systemhas a parallel to our visual system.In our visual system, that light entering the eyestriggers the activation of those melanopsin cells,which triggers activation of the hypothalamus,a particular area of the hypothalamus,which generates alertness, generates the release,even of cortisol, a stress hormone.In the auditory system, when there's ongoing sound,your auditory system hears that,even if you're not paying attention to it,if you're paying attention to something else,it's still registers.Those little hair cells, as they're called in your inner earare fluttering, the eardrum is beatingand in concert to that sound frequency.And there's a brainstem mechanism that generates alertnessand a kind of vigilant.So when you have a sound that's ongoing in the background,it shuts off, all of a sudden you experienced that peace,which is the turning off of those brainstem circuitsthat are associated with vigilance, the locus coeruleus,which we talked about earlier, which release epinephrinand norepinephrine and generate the heightened stateof alertness in your brain and body,those neurons then can turn offand you experience that as relaxation.So does that mean that we shouldn't listen to white noiseor pink noise or brown noise while we're working?Certainly a lot of people do.In fact, if you want to know what white noise,pink noise and brown noise are,they're just different constellationsof auditory frequencies that are played together.Most of us think of white noiseas the [shushing] on a screen,all the black and white pixels going all around,like they call it visual snow, but pink noisehas certain sound frequencies, notched out,taken out, brown noise has others.It has different frequencies that are includedat higher amplitude, et cetera.You can look this stuff up on YouTube,if you want, you to just put brown noise.None of it sounds terrific, it doesn't sound like music.It's literally just noise, mixed frequenciesin no particular arrangement.There is some evidence that playing white noisein the background or on headphones or pink noiseor brown noise can facilitate cognition,but it's mainly through an increasein this overall alertness as a consequenceof areas like locus coeruleus and other brainstem areasthat are associated with autonomic arousalfrom that noise.So it's a lot like the air conditioner effect.And I think done in a restricted way,meaning not for hours and hours, but maybe if your focusis waning and you're having a hard time engaging in work,you might put on some brown noise or white noiseor pink noise and work that way for 45 minutes or sobefore you go to your panoramic vision walkand get some sunlight, that should be fine.There's really no reason to suspect, however,that those particular patterns of noiseare going to optimize particular mental functions.So what I'd like to turn to next are particular patternsof sounds that indeed have been shownin peer-reviewed studies to optimize certain typesof mental processing, because you can incorporate theseinto your optimized workspace environment,through headphones or through speakers,whatever mechanism that you want,in order to get more out of your work efforts.If you were to search for apps or go online and try and findsounds that can improve thinking or change your emotions.You're generally going to find three types.One are called isochronic tones,these are tones usually of a common frequency.So it might be a beep and then a pause, and then beepof the same frequency, and then beep,forgive my terrible beeping.I don't know what good beeping would sound like,but contrast isochronic tones with monaural beats.Monaural beats would be repetitive,almost percussive like beats delivered to just one ear,[vocalizing], this kind of thing.You can find apps that can deliver monaural beats,you can find also apps that deliverso-called binaural beats.You can also find YouTube scripts or channelsthat will deliver binaural beats.Binaural beats as the name suggests,are beats delivered to the two ears,one pattern of kind of percussive beat to one earand a different pattern, or at least a patternthat's out of phase, that's not synchronized,delivered to the other ear.So on one ear you hear, [vocalizing]and in the other ear, you've got [vocalizing].And what happens is because of the waythat the auditory system converges in the brainstemand generates what are called interaural time differences,I'll explain what that means in a moment,interaural time differences, the differencebetween the two patterns of beats that are heardby each of the two different ears, leads to a third patternthat the brain entrains to, and kind of maps ontoand generates particular types of brainwaves.So without going into a lot of detail,interaural time differences are the waysin which if you were to hear something off to your right,like I just snapped my finger just to the rightof my right ear, that a signal arrives in my right earbefore that's sound signal, those sound waves arrivein my left ear.So there's an interaural between ears, time difference.And there's a brainstem area in which signals from one earand signals from the other ear converge,and there's literally a math done by your nervous systemthat says this signal arrived before the other signal.And the difference between those signalsis the interaural time difference.So if I were to snap my fingers on both sideson my left and on my right side of the exact same time,and they arrive at the same time,the interaural time difference is zero.Whereas if one goes first on the right and then the left,I'm terrible at snapping on the left, it's a weak snap,but it was there, then there's a delayand the interaural time difference has a particular value.Okay, you get it, it's almost ridiculously simple.Binaural beats have been generated in waysthat create a particular patternof interaural time differences that then cascadesup to the rest of the brain and puts the forebrainand other areas of the brain that are involved in cognitionand action into a particular rhythm.And some of the rhythms or waves of brain activity are onesthat you may have heard of, things like alpha wavesor theta waves or gamma waves.Now I don't like to get too attachedto particular brain waves as excellentfor particular kinds of thinking.This is something that was really popularin the 90s and 2000s, when ways of measuring brain activity,noninvasively with electrodes on the outside,enabled people to identify the indeed alpha brain wavesare associated with alertness states.And some are other brainwavesthat are kind of larger amplitudes,slow waves like delta waves are associatedwith kind of sleepiness or relaxation, but in general,the way that the brain works is that different brain wavesare generated in different structures at different times.And those combine to give us a sense of happiness or give usa sense of focus or give us a sense of creativity.Nonetheless, if you look across the board at the studiesof binaural beats and you ask what sorts of binaural beatsappear to be useful for people to enhancetheir brain function for particular kinds of tasks,we arrive at some very interesting answers.So we'll review what those are now.The frequency of binaural beats that appears to bring aboutimproved cognitive functioning at the level of memory,improved reaction times and improved verbal recall,seems to be 40 Hertz.Now, is it exactly 40 Hertz?We don't know, but if one wants to look upa great reference on this, they reference Colzato,C-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017 describes and here, I'm quoting,so this is a direct quote."The present findings are in line"with those of a recent study, which also found"faster reaction times in participants"that listen to binaural beats at 40 Hertz."And you can find many examples of this in the literaturewhere binaural beats have about 40 Hertzor exactly 40 Hertz, in some cases,somehow brought the brain into a state that made it optimalfor learning, for memory and for certain types of recall,including verbal recall, math learning, et cetera.So for those of you that are interested in binaural beats,there are a number of free apps out there.I'm not going to recommend any in particular,just have to search for one that you happen to like.One thing that you will find is that many of those appssuper-imposed binaural beats onto raindrops or ocean soundsor that rather they superimpose ocean sounds and raindropsonto the binaural beats, that does not appearto be as effective as pure binaural beats.There has been an explorationof lower frequency binaural beats.So for instance, seven Hertz, which is theta binaural beatsdone for 30 minutes with an overlay of rain soundor rain sounds only that's been analyzedand believe it or not, that showed immediate recall memorywas significantly decreased.So that's a negative effect of binaural beats on memory.So the idea that binaural beats are just great for usacross the board, I think is wrong.It does appear that the higher frequency binaural beatsas one moves up toward 40 Hertzare going to be the most beneficial.There are instances in which for instance,15 Hertz binaural beats increased response accuracyon a spatial verbal memory task.This is a complicated working memory task.Working memory is the kind of memoryof remembering a phone number.So if I say for instance, 4932931,and you have to remember that number,keeping it online is what we call your working memory.It's likely that you would forget thattwo or three days later.You can get improvements in working memorywith 15 Hertz binaural beats,whereas the other control conditions,five Hertz and 10 Hertz binaural beats,all decreased accuracy of working memory.However, when I looked at the literatureand I examined a number of different studies,what I always seem to come back to was that 40 Hertz or soplus or minus five Hertz seemed to be optimalfor generating improvements in cognition,in math performance, and even in various typesof memory recall, and even in musical performance.You might wonder, well, how can people domusical performance, they're listening to binaural beats.Here's another surprise, many of the studiesthat I looked at didn't have people listeningto binaural beats while they were doing the tasks,the memory task, or the music learning, et cetera,they would do it beforehand for 30 minutes.There were instances in which people were listeningto binaural beats during the task.But if you decide to employ binaural beats,I recommend this 40 Hertz as a great place to start.I don't recommend doing it for all of your work bouts.I think there's a good reason to believethat you can attenuate to it.But if you are going to try it, you might try it both ways.You might try listening to binaural beatsfor about 30 minutes while doing something elseand then maybe eating lunch or something of that sort,or taking a walk and then going into the work about.Because remember the moment that you start listeningto these binaural beats, the brain doesn't immediatelyswitch into a particular pattern of oscillationor brain waves, it takes some time.Neural circuits, again, take time to engage.The only neural circuits that are going to engage instantlyare going be the ones that are of a sort of reflexive sort,like you step on a sharp objectand you have to retract your limb,or you suddenly are stressed by a distressing text message,or you're suddenly delightedabout a delightful text message.But when it comes to shifting your whole brain statetoward optimizing work, it takes a little bit of time.So again, 40 Hertz binaural beats, many, many apps,many YouTube scripts out there, probably other resourcesfor binaural beats, hopefully zero cost,so you can access those without any needto shell out any money.If you find one that you particularly like,maybe put in the comment section,so other people can find it,YouTube would be the best place to do that.Feel free to put a link or just a description,that will be wonderful.And again, you don't need to listen to binaural beatsat the exact same time that you're doing the work,although that could also enhance your productivity.Some of you out there might be cravinga little bit more mechanism by which binaural beatscan influence things like focus or reduced reaction time.This has actually been explored,this 40 Hertz binaural beats pattern seems to have an effecton what's called striatal dopamine.We have dopamine as a neuromodulator of course,involved in many things in motivation,it's actually involved in adaptation to light in the retina.Something that most people don't know,but it's involved in movement, which is why peoplewith Parkinson's who have a depletion of dopamine neuronsactually have movement deficits and so on.But striatal dopamine is closely relatedto motivation and focus.And 40 Hertz binaural beats appears to increasestriatal dopamine release.And this has actually been measured indirectlyby what we call spontaneous blink rate.Now I've been accused on various Instagram posts,and even on this podcast of being a non-blinker,let's call it, or a minimal blinker.And as an important aside, there is no evidence whatsoeverthat people that don't blink very muchare sociopaths or lie.Also, you will hear that people who blink a lotare sociopaths and are lying.There's absolutely no evidence that blink frequencycorrelates with anything except alertness.Now longer blinks are associated with less alertness.As we get tired, we tend to blink longer and longeruntil we take the long blink that is sleep.I guess the long blink would be death,but the longish blink would be sleep.But it turns out that the more firing of striatal dopamineneurons that's occurring, the more frequently we blink.And so it is associated with a resettingof our visual window, that's what happens when we blinkand there's a whole relationship between blinkingand time perception that we coveredin the episode on time perception.But here's the bottom line for sake of this discussion.40 Hertz binaural beats appears to increasespontaneous blink rates because it increasesdopamine transmission in the brainstem and in the striatumin several locations in fact.And so the way in which these binaural beatsset a rhythm in the brain, recruits dopamine release.That dopamine release leads to heightened levelsof motivation and focus, why motivation and focus?Well, dopamine is actually the substrateby which epinephrin is made.Dopamine, the molecule is actually converted into epinephrinadrenaline and they work together like close cousins,dopamine and epinephrin in order to put us on a pathof movement or if we are doing work,of mental movement toward a goal.So that's a little bit of mechanistic meat to explainat least part of the reason why 40 Hertz binaural beatscan enhance our focus, reduce our reaction timesand improve indeed learning and memory.Next I'd like to talk about the role of movementin optimizing our workspace and whether or not standing,sitting, lying down, treadmilling or even believe it or not,cycling, can enhance our work output and performance.Before we do that, I want to touch on two aspectsof optimizing workspace that will come up at some pointin your work or school life.Alas, there isn't a lot of science around this,but I think they are worth mentioning.And I think I can offer a little bit of advicein terms of how to navigate thesein a way that would be beneficial to you.The first one is interruptions.If you go online and you askabout how to avoid interruptions, people will say,okay, well, if you have kids at home or even if you don'tor at work, you'll have a light, like a recording lightwith recording is on we're, we're busy now,or have a sign on the door that saysbother only in a case of emergencyor find to knock or don't knock at all.I've used a different policy throughout the years.I am somebody who works pretty hard to control my timeand focus, but of course, as a laboratory director,I have people coming by and who want to talk about things.And of course we have phones and we have computersand people's opportunity to reach us.Interruptions really are deadlyto our ability to generate focus.And it's not just about the distraction that occursof say a minute or two minutes or five minuteswhen we were interrupted,it's also about the additional timeto get those brain circuits to re-engage to a mode of focus.So it's really kind of a double whammy.Now, none of us, including myself want to be harshor cruel or shut off from the worldand oftentimes interruptions bring incredible insightsand people are providing support and very useful thingsthat are essential to my workday and presumablyto your workday in school day as well.But there's a simple method that I learnedfrom my graduate advisor that works very, very well.Again, no peer review data to support it,this is just my experience, but this is somebodywho had immense powers of focus,had a very, very demanding life, a long commute to children,extensive laboratory, et cetera.And what she would do was if I came by and asked a question,or if anyone came by and asked a question,she would acknowledge their presence,but would not shift her body toward them.So she purposely did not position her computerfacing the door, which I think is a deadly or I should say,deadly to focus a way of positioning your workspace.So her computer was facing the wall,the door was perpendicular to that.And I would come by and I say, I have a question.She would say yes, so she would acknowledge my presence,but she wouldn't actually orient her body toward me,which told me that this conversationwas not going to last very long.And no matter how long I stood there or what I asked,she would never orient toward me,which generally kept these conversations very, very short.We had other designated meetingswhere we would be face-to-face.The other approach, which I confesscolleagues of mine have used before,not necessarily at Stanford, but elsewhere is to simply sayno to everything that somebody requests or comes by.So if someone would knock on the door,they would just shout no through the door,or if someone said, can I bother you for a second?They would say, no, or if someone said,I have something I want to tell you, they would just say no.And they would just continue doing thisuntil the person went away.That was actually very effective,these were some of the most productive people I know,not always the kindest, but some of them were very kind.The other approach that I've seenand actually this is an approach that was used by someonewho has been a guest on The Huberman Lab Podcast,someone who's immensely productive was that he,so I'm constraining who this might be by saying he,he actually, despite having the optionto have a very large office, would place himselfin a workspace that was literally a coat closet,cleared out with a desk, small lamp, completely dark.So this violates everything that I've talked about beforeor prior to this, everything about high ceilings,bright light, et cetera, and would work,still works underneath a desk lampin a completely dark closet, minimal ventilation.This is my definition of hell.And yet is one of the most productive people on the planet.Also very, very hard to find, I actually knowwhere his closet is, turns out he has several of themthat he migrates from in order to avoid distractions.So I mentioned these as kind of extremes,I think that most of us exist on the other extreme.And that's why I mentioned it, which is that most of uslike some social engagement and a welcome,or at least set our work environmentin a way that welcomes interruptionand we have to be very, very careful about this.Now in the digital realm, I already mentioneda few of the things that we can do as practical toolsto limit interruptions.One is use the program Freedom,the other would be to simply turn off the wifi.If you do need to be online and navigating,you're doing research of any kind,that's not going to be possible.Turning off one's phone, I've at times,put my phone on airplane mode, if that didn't work,I've locked it in a safe, I've done that,I'd left in the car outside.It all depends on one's levels of self-discipline,which as you probably know, from your own experience,tends to kind of wax and wane.Sometimes we are betterat avoiding these distractions than others.So if you find yourself in a place where it's very hardto reduce those distractions,you may need you to go to more elaborate lanes.I will say that a graduate student in my labwho was immensely productive and focused,had the habit of coming in each day,she would take her phone, I don't know if she turned it on,or off or not, and she would just place it in a door,excuse me, in a drawerand would then go start doing experiments.We do experiments all day at 10 courses,engage in discussions avidly with the rest of us,and then would take her phone outat the end of the day and leave.And I don't think that behavior was not correlatedwith her immense productivity.I think the ability to untether ourselves from the phoneis going to be the way in which many of usare either going to succeed or fail in our various pursuits.I'm somebody who engages on with the phoneon a regular basis throughout the day for various reasons,but I do try and have large swaths of the dayin which it's either on airplane modeor it's completely physically separated from me.When I'm in large swaths, I might do every other hourwith the phone on airplane modeor even a two or three hour about where I just am simplynot engaged with the phone at all.So is it better to sit or is it better to standwhen doing work, at least as it relatesto focus and productivity?And the answer is both.There've been a number of systematic studiesexploring what are called sit-stand desks.So these are desks that can be set to a heightthat makes standing the best practice,and then they can be lowered to a heightthat makes sitting the best practiceor the easiest practice I should say.And it turns out that just sitting is terrible for usand there's an enormous number of studies out therethat have pointed the fact that people who sitfor five or six or seven hours a day doing work,have all sorts of issues related to sleep, neck pain,cognition suffers, their number of cardiovascular effects,even digestion, there may even actually besome almost pressure effects on the pelvic floorand things of that sort, depending on the chairsthat one uses.But that people who stand are in a slightly better situationwhere many of those health metrics improve,but that people that do a combination of sittingand standing at the same desk throughout the day,or move from one desk to another,if they don't have a combination sit-stand desk,that's going to be best.The good news is it's very easy to convert a sit deskinto a stand desk, you can just stack some boxes,I've done this at times or stack books.There are also some pedestalsand things that you can purchase if that's your preferencein order to set your computer at a particular height.And of course there are desks that have motorsand they're ones that have cranks,and there are all sorts of variations,both in terms of the types and whether or notthey have motors as well as the cost to these things.So they can go from very low cost, like placing boxesor books to create a standing desk,to very high cost in some cases.Now what's interesting,if you look at a scientific literature,is that people who decreased their sitting timeby about half each day.So they took, let's say they were workingfor seven hours a day, three and a half hours of that day,they decide to stand, and it's not even clearthat it matters that they do all those three hoursin one about, or they divide that upinto shorter bouts of a half an hour,and then sit for half an hour, et cetera,alternating back and forth showed incredibly significanteffects on reduced neck and shoulder pain,increase in subjective health,vitality in a work-related environments.And perhaps most importantly, for sake of today's discussionimprovement in cognitive conditioningand the ability to embrace new tasksand cognitive performance.There are several studies that if one wanted to explore,they could explore this in more detail.I'll put a link to this as well.The article that I'm referring tois called "Effects of a Workplace"Sit-Stand Desk Intervention on Health and Productivity."And I like this paper because many of the papers out therefocus on the effects of sit-stand desks on healthin trying to get people to burn more calories,improve their posture, relieve neck pain,slumped over, et cetera, but not on productivity.And this particular paper focusesalso on the metrics of productivity,it has its own study and also referencesa number of important studies.What does this mean for you and me?Well, I've long used a standing deskor some variation thereof.What this means is that we should probably spendabout half of our work time standingand about half of it sitting,but not all sitting or not all standing.If you had to do all one or the other,standing is going to be better than sitting.What happens if we just stand?Well, that can also generate some postural issuesin terms of stabilization and fatigue.I have a good friend who's in the movementand physical rehabilitation and physiology space,his name is Kelly Starrett, he's very impressivein all those domains, and he always says,we weren't designed to sit all day,but we also weren't designed to stand all day.And I think that's true, if we were to look backat our species over tens or hundreds of thousands of years,we would find that indeed, we did sit down, we did lie down.It wasn't that we were standing all day long.That said, almost everybody, at least in the U.S.,is not getting sufficient cardiovascular exerciseor movement throughout the day.And standing at one's desk can improvesome of those health metrics, and again,can improve productivity, probably because of thosepostural effects that I talked about earlier,that when we lie down, there tends to be less alertnessin our brainstem, if you will and there's less activationof those brainstem circuits involved in alertness.And indeed that circuits that involvea kind of a calming effect on the body, get activated.And as we become upright, standing or sitting,but especially standing, then those brainstem circuitsfor alertness kick on, which are going to make it easierto remain focused.If you are going to start standingfor half of your work time,you will notice that it takes a few days to adapt.You'll notice a lot of shifting from side to side,definitely want to wear comfortable shoes.Some people do this on a wooden floor,other people feel uncomfortable unless they're on carpet.You have to figure out what works for you,but it can take a little bit of time to adapt.After say after now, about 10 years of workingat a sit-stand desk, I find I can't sit for too longbefore I want to stand.And my standing bouts can be anywhere from 30 minutesto two hours, although two hours would be a little bit long.And then I catch myself kind of leaning on the deskoff to the side.So again, the idea is to stand,but not be leaning on the desk,obviously, if you're typing or you're writing,there'll be some leaning involved,but that's what the literature support.There is also a literature on whether or notphysical movement under your desk, meaning treadmillingor in fact, there are now bicyclesthat allow people to peddle.It's kind of a unicycle like thing,although not a unicycle under the desk,can be beneficial for workplace performance.So let's take a look at what those data say.The study that I'm referring to has a first author,Frod Sham, F-R-O-D S-H-A-M, Frod Sham et al.This is a research article published in plus one,and the title of the article is,"Does Type of Active Workstation Matter:"A Randomized Comparison of Cognitive and Typing Performance"Between Rest, Cycling and Treadmill, Active Workstation."It's amazing that people do this science,I think it's great.Where else would we get peer-reviewed dataon these types of questions?First things first, there were no significant differencesbetween cycling or treadmill workstationson any cognitive or typing outcomes.So it does not seem to matter whether or not peopleare treadmilling under the desk.So these would be stationary treadmills,it's like a little conveyor that people are walking on.Sometimes very slowly, I'm guessing some peoplewalk more quickly, the New Yorkersprobably treadmill quicker.The California's probably treadmill a little slower,I'm in Californian, so I can make that quote unquote joke,but nonetheless, there were no significant differencesbetween that and a cycling station where people are sittingand peddling as they type away or as they work,or as they're on phone calls, et cetera.So it really doesn't seem to matter.So if you're going to embrace these active workstations,as they're called, just decide what you would prefer to use.It doesn't seem to matter in terms of outcomes.Now, this study involved looking at 137 young adults.They had multiple sessions where they at first completedcognitive and typing tests,these tests have different names, and you're welcometo look those up if you like, as well as flanker tasks,so these are tasks of attention and things of that sort.And then they either engaged in treadmill or cyclingand then there was a comparison.And the statistics were run, and basically what they foundwas there was a statistically significant improvementin attention and cognitive control scoresduring any kind of active session,as opposed to just a mere seated session.So they compared seated to cycling to treadmilling.However, verbal memory scores actually got worseduring active sessions.So I'll repeat that, treadmillingor the cycling workstations, improved attentionand cognitive control scores as compared to peoplethat were just seated and working.However, verbal memory scores got worseduring the active sessions, and again, just to repeat,there was no difference between cyclingand treadmill workstations.So this is interesting, I suggest that as the author saythat active workstations, whether walking or cyclingare not only useful to improve caloric outputand physical activity, circulation and so on,but particularly when completing tasks like cognitive tasksor tasks that require focus that do not requireverbal memory recall.Now why verbal memory recall was negatively impacted,we don't know, it could be because people were breathinga little bit harder.It could be that there's something about walkingand talking that seems incompatible in the nervous system,although I'm not aware of that.I know a number of people who can walk and talkat the same time, but if you are going to explorethese treadmills or you're going to explorethese cycling stations, you probably wouldn't wantto do that for highly verbal work,maybe more for mathematical work or for analytic workor even creative work.But anything that involves very precise or detailedverbal recall, sitting or standingseems to be the better option.And if you're wondering why cycling or treadmillingwould enhance various aspects of cognition,we can speculate.I've talked before about this, but anytime we are generatingforward movement through our own actions, our own efforts,typically, if we are outside, we're not on a treadmillor we're out on a bicycle or running,or even on a motorcycle or in a car,we have what's called optic flow.And that optic flow is known to quiet certain areasof the brain that are associated with vigilanceand indeed fear.This is the basis of things like EMDR,eye movement desensitization reprocessing.However, the mere act of engaging what are calledour central pattern generators,the neurons in our brain stem and in our spinal cordthat engage repetitive movements also can reducesome of the areas of the brain that are associatedwith anxiety and vigilance.So one pure speculation, but nonethelessgrounded speculation would be that treadmillingor cycling at a desk would reduce anxietythat would allow performance to improve.The other, what I think is more likely explanationis that anytime we are in ambulation,we recruit the release of neuromodulators like epinephrindopamine and things of that sort, that further increaseoverall levels of alertness.I think that's the more likely explanationbecause it's hard to imagine how just a reduction in anxietycould lead to these improvements in cognitionin a direct way.Whereas the subjects in the study, I just mentionedon average experienced an increasein cognitive performance merely by movement.And this does not include any optic flowbecause it's stationary,the treadmill or the cycle is stationary.And so we can rule out that optic flow,and that points to the idea that when we are in movement,we recruit neuromodulators associated with the so-calledreticular activating system,the striatal system and so forth,that would place the brain into some pattern.We don't know, we only can speculate some pattern,perhaps it's gamma waves or some other wave patternthat would engage heightened levels of focus and attention.Nonetheless, treadmilling, cycling at a desk,does improve cognition.So we've been discussing workspace optimizationwith the understanding that you're not always going to workin the same place every day.What I've tried to do is give you a setof high potency tools that can improve your focusand cognition, and to place that within a frameworkfor particular kinds of work.Let's just review some of the basic elementsof what we've covered today.First of all, in the first part of your day,that zero to nine hours after waking,you want bright lights, especially overhead lights,as bright as you can keep themwithout feeling uncomfortable,or certainly not without feeling any pain in your eyesor elsewhere in your body.Bright lights will make for the maximum state of alertness.In addition, try and place, whatever it isthat you're focusing on directly in front of you,but not have it extend too far outto either side of your eyes, try and generatea fairly restricted visual window as we call it.And if you can, try and place whatever it isyou're focusing on at least at nose level or above,that it might take some engineering or some ingenuityand creativity in order to figure out how to do that,but that's going to be most beneficial.Try and avoid reclining, try and avoid sitting,try and stand for at least half of your work day.That's a good goal, and it may take some timeto work up to that goal.In addition, if you're going to use soundas a stimulus for increasing focus and alertness,trying to avoid exposure to white noise, pink noiseor brown noise for extended periods of time,for more than an hour or so, that might actually be damagingto the auditory system.And at the very least, is kind of stressful,even though you might not notice it,it's kind of a background level of anxiety and stressthat is not going to serve you well.Rather, if you're going to pursue particular typesof sound frequencies consider using 40 Hertz binaural beats,not monaural beats, but 40 Hertz binaural beatsdone during a particular work about or for 30 minutesprior to that work about.I would not rely on binaural beats all the time, every day,I think that could cause them to lose their potency,just because of the way the auditory system attenuates.And actually you've experienced that attenuation,the mere fact that you can go into an environmentwhere there's an air conditioner, blowing, blowing, blowing,and then it stops, and you feel that relaxation,but you weren't thinking about the air conditioner before,it tells you that your auditory systemhad kind of attenuated to itand yet it was still impacting your system.You were sensing it, we would say, but not perceiving it.There are other things that you can doto improve your workspace optimizationsuch as standing for half the day, as I mentioned before,but if you're interested in thisor you feel like it suits you to treadmill,find a stationary treadmill that you can walk on.I've never tried this before, maybe after this episode,given what I've read in the peer-reviewed research,and it's pretty compelling, that treadmilling seemslike an interesting way to increase alertnessand cognitive performance.I'm not sure that I would do the cycling methodbecause I can't imagine just cyclingand typing at the same time, that sort feels like,like I actually can do the rub here,tell me pat your head kind of thing.But it still feels like a little bitof a sort of a cognitive motor collision for mefor whatever reason, but that's just my bias.I do know how to ride a bicycle, but anyway,you pick your preference.Some other things that you could doin order to improve your workplace performancewould be to consider the cathedral effect.If you're going to do analytic work for any part of the day,phase one or phase two, as I described them,but really in any time of day, that detailed analytic workfor which there is a correct answer,learning scales of music, learning mathematics,trying to figure out the solution to a problemwhere there is indeed a solution.It could be an interpersonal problem as well,then try and get into an environmentwith a relatively low ceiling.If you don't have access to a low ceiling environment,you might consider using a brimmed hat or even a hoodie,or even just facing down, or even putting your handabove your eyes, as you will, at the level of your eyebrows.In other words, lower the ceiling, that's the basisof the cathedral effects on analytic performance.In contrast, if you're interested in doing brainstorming,creative work, you're writing new things,you're creating new things of any kind, artwork,consider getting into a high ceilingor no ceiling environment, or if you're wearinga brimmed hat or you're wearing a hoodie,maybe peel that back.Again, the data within the peer reviewed literatureare there to support these sorts of practices.And if you'd like to start layering these protocols,by all means, please do that.There's no reason why you couldn't do oneor just two of these protocols.There's no reason why, for instance,you couldn't use binaural beats and try and getinto a low ceiling environment to do detailed worka couple times a week,but you could also employ all of these.Now, of course, there are an enormous number of other thingsthat you can do to improve work performanceand productivity, and I've talked about thosein previous episodes, in particular,in the episode on focus and the episode on motivation,there are supplements you can takethat can increase dopamine, for instance.There are tools that you can use to increase your focus,for instance, focusing your visual attentionon one location for 30 to 60 secondsprior to entering a focused work about,this has been shown again and again.The work from Emily Bell, that's at NYUin the episode on focus, I cited a number of studieswhere this has actually been testedand deployed in various schools.Having kids do a focus task where they lookat a particular visual target for 30 to 60 seconds,then doing some mathematics and seeingpretty impressive improvement in focus and attention,even in people that have attention deficit,hyperactivity disorder and so on.So there's no reason why you can't and shouldn't combinethe sort of practical workspace optimization solutionsthat we talked about today with the kindof neural optimization solutions that we talked aboutin the episode on focus and the episode on ADHDand the episode on motivation.By all means, layer those together,that's how you're going to achieve the optimal focus bouts,that's how you're going to achievethe optimal creativity bouts.I do want to acknowledge again, the fact that I realizedpeople are showing up to this challengeof workspace optimization with different budgets,with different constraints.Some people have kids at home,there are a lot of interruption, some people do not.Nonetheless, I hope that the informationI was able to provide today will allow youto make subtle or maybe even drastic rearrangementsin your workspace environment.There's one other point related to that,that I did not cover and that I'd like to coverjust briefly, which is that there's nothing to saythat you have to always work in the same locationall the time.You can move from house to cafe if that works for you,you can move from office to home,you can also move from different locations within your home.I have a brief anecdote about this.I used to attend a lot of scientific meetingswhen a lot of scientific meetings were in person,and there were always a few individualsthat seem to stay engagedthroughout these very long meetings.And we're talking seven, eight hour day,sometimes evening sessions, and sometimes these meetingswould go on for, four or five or even six days.These are long meetings and the quality of talksvary tremendously, and I always notice the individualsthat manage to stay engaged and awakefor the entire meeting.And I noticed that people that could maintainhigh levels of alertness in this one conference roomhad a habit of moving to a different seatafter each session, sometimes even between talks.And I actually discussed this with one of my colleagueswho was doing this, I said, is this conscious,are you always moving from place to place?And he said, yeah, if I just stay in one placeand I just look from this one particular visual angleof the screen, I find after one or two talks,regardless of how interesting the talks are,that I start take on of draft, my mind isn't as engagedand indeed, sometimes can fall asleep.And so I started this practice of movingfrom space to space, or I should say,seat to seat within an auditorium and it works quite well.And I think it works quite well because again,of the relationship between our visual systemdriving the majority of our cognition,our visual system drives our thinkingand that novel visual environmentsare going to lend themselvesto heightened levels of alertness.Now, you don't want things to be so novel and scaryor threatening or anxiety-provoking or loudthat they draw your attention away from your work.But I think this is part of the reason why turning on musicor moving to an office or a cafe or an outdoor environmentfrom an indoor environment or vice versa,maybe even within a single day, can bring aboutmore heightened levels of productivity.I'd also like to acknowledge that what I covered todayis most certainly not exhaustivefor all the types of workspace optimization toolsthat one could create.For that reason, I'd love for you to suggestany of your workspace optimization toolsthat you found useful.Please put those in the comment section on YouTube,that would be the best place than other people can see them.Also read through those, and perhaps in a future episode,I'll call about some of the ones that I've triedon the basis of your suggestions.If you're learning from, and are enjoying this podcast,please subscribe to our YouTube channel.That's a terrific zero cost way to support us.Also on YouTube, you can put commentsin the comment section, so give us feedback.You can make suggestions for future gueststhat you'd like us to host on The Huberman Lab Podcast.And in general, you can ask questions.We do eventually read all the commentsand they do influence our future content.Please also subscribe on Apple and/or Spotify.And on Apple, you have the opportunity to leave usup to a five star review.Please also check out the sponsors mentionedat the beginning of this podcast episode,that's the best way to support the podcast.We also have a Patreon, it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,and there you can support the podcastat any level that you like.We also have an Instagram and a Twitter account,it's Huberman Lab, and there I teach neuroscienceand neuroscience related tools.Oftentimes that information and those tools overlapwith themes on the podcast, but sometimes they are distinctfrom themes and topics covered on the podcast.So please follow us on Instagram and Twitter.This episode, we didn't talk too much about supplements,but on many previous episodes of The Huberman Lab Podcast,we talk about supplementation and while supplementationisn't required or great for everybody,some people do derive tremendous benefit from supplements.We talked about supplements for focus, for sleep,for creativity, all sorts of things.If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,you can go to Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/U/Huberman,there, you can see the supplements that I take,you can get 20% off those supplements.And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site,through that portal, Thorne thorne.com/u/huberman,you can also get 20% off.Any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.The reason we partner with Thorneis because one of the major issuesin the supplement industry is that many of the supplementsout there don't contain sufficient quantity,or they contain too much of a given supplement.And the quality of the ingredients can vary tremendously.With Thorne supplements, there is immense stringencyin terms of the quality of the ingredientsand the precision of the amounts of those ingredientsthat they include in each product.Once again, thank you for joining me for this discussionabout the science and peer-reviewed literatureon workspace optimization.I hope some, if not, all of the toolswill be beneficial for you, and as alwaysthank you for your interest in science.
